Abstract
The rising popularity of intelligent mobile devices and
the daunting computational cost of deep learning-based
models call for efﬁcient and accurate on-device inference
schemes. We propose a quantization scheme that allows
inference to be carried out using integer-only arithmetic,
which can be implemented more efﬁciently than ﬂoating
point inference on commonly available integer-only hard-
ware. We also co-design a training procedure to preserve
end-to-end model accuracy post quantization. As a result,
the proposed quantization scheme improves the tradeoff be-
tween accuracy and on-device latency. The improvements
are signiﬁcant even on MobileNets, a model family known
for run-time efﬁciency, and are demonstrated in ImageNet
classiﬁcation and COCO detection on popular CPUs.
1. Introduction
Current state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) are not well suited for use on mobile devices. Since
the advent of AlexNet [ 20], modern CNNs have primarily
been appraised according to classiﬁcation / detection accu-
racy. Thus network architectures have evolved without re-
gard to model complexity and computational efﬁciency. On
the other hand, successful deployment of CNNs on mobile
platforms such as smartphones, AR/VR devices (HoloLens,
Daydream), and drones require small model sizes to accom-
modate limited on-device memory, and low latency to main-
tain user engagement. This has led to a burgeoning ﬁeld of
research that focuses on reducing the model size and infer-
ence time of CNNs with minimal accuracy losses.
Approaches in this ﬁeld roughly fall into two cate-
gories. The ﬁrst category, exempliﬁed by MobileNet [ 10],
SqueezeNet [ 16], ShufﬂeNet [ 32], and DenseNet [ 11], de-
signs novel network architectures that exploit computation
/ memory efﬁcient operations. The second category quan-tizes the weights and / or activations of a CNN from 32
bit ﬂoating point into lower bit-depth representations. This
methodology, embraced by approaches such as Ternary
weight networks (TWN [ 22]), Binary Neural Networks
(BNN [ 14]), XNOR-net [ 27], and more [ 8,21,26,33,34,
35], is the focus of our investigation. Despite their abun-
dance, current quantization approaches are lacking in two
respects when it comes to trading off latency with accuracy.
First, prior approaches have not been evaluated on a
reasonable baseline architecture. The most common base-
line architectures, AlexNet [ 20], VGG [ 28] and GoogleNet
[29], are all over-parameterized by design in order to extract
marginal accuracy improvements. Therefore, it is easy to
obtain sizable compression of these architectures, reducing
quantization experiments on these architectures to proof-
of-concepts at best. Instead, a more meaningful challenge
would be to quantize model architectures that are already ef-
ﬁcient at trading off latency with accuracy, e.g. MobileNets.
Second, many quantization approaches do not deliver
veriﬁable efﬁciency improvements on real hardware. Ap-
proaches that quantize only the weights ([ 2,4,8,33]) are
primarily concerned with on-device storage and less with
computational efﬁciency. Notable exceptions are binary,
ternary and bit-shift networks [ 14,22,27]. These latter
approaches employ weights that are either 0 or powers of
2, which allow multiplication to be implemented by bit
shifts. However, while bit-shifts can be efﬁcient in cus-
tom hardware, they provide little beneﬁt on existing hard-
ware with multiply-add instructions that, when properly
used (i.e. pipelined), are not more expensive than addi-
tions alone. Moreover, multiplications are only expensive
if the operands are wide, and the need to avoid multiplica-
tions diminishes with bit depth once both weights and acti-
vations are quantized. Notably, these approaches rarely pro-
vide on-device measurements to verify the promised timing
improvements. More runtime-friendly approaches quantize
both the weights and the activations into 1 bit representa-

are represented as 8-bit integers according to equation 1. The convolution involves 8-bit integer operands and a 32-bit integer accumulator.

Weight quantization (“wt quant”) and activation quantization (“act quant”) nodes are injected into the computation graph to simulate the
effects of quantization of the variables (section 3). The resultant graph approximates the integer-arithmetic-only computation graph in panel
a), while being trainable using conventional optimization algorithms for ﬂoating point models. c)Our quantization scheme beneﬁts from
the fast integer-arithmetic circuits in common CPUs to deliver an improved latency-vs-accuracy tradeoff (section 4). The ﬁgure compares

tions [ 14,27,34]. With these approaches, both multiplica-
tions and additions can be implemented by efﬁcient bit-shift
and bit-count operations, which are showcased in custom
GPU kernels (BNN [ 14]). However, 1 bit quantization of-
ten leads to substantial performance degradation, and may
be overly stringent on model representation.
In this paper we address the above issues by improving
the latency-vs-accuracy tradeoffs of MobileNets on com-
mon mobile hardware. Our speciﬁc contributions are:
•We provide a quantization scheme (section 2.1) that
quantizesh both weights and activations as 8-bit integers,
and just a few parameters (bias vectors) as 32-bit integers.
•We provide a quantized inference framework that is ef-
ﬁciently implementable on integer-arithmetic-only hard-
ware such as the Qualcomm Hexagon (sections 2.2,2.3),
and we describe an efﬁcient, accurate implementation on
ARM NEON (Appendix B).
•We provide a quantized training framework (section 3)
co-designed with our quantized inference to minimize the
loss of accuracy from quantization on real models.
•We apply our frameworks to efﬁcient classiﬁcation and
detection systems based on MobileNets and provide
benchmark results on popular ARM CPUs (section 4)
that show signiﬁcant improvements in the latency-vs-
accuracy tradeoffs for state-of-the-art MobileNet archi-
tectures, demonstrated in ImageNet classiﬁcation [ 3],
COCO object detection [ 23], and other tasks.Our work draws inspiration from [ 7], which leverages
low-precision ﬁxed-point arithmetic to accelerate the train-
ing speed of CNNs, and from [ 31], which uses 8-bit ﬁxed-
point arithmetic to speed up inference on x86 CPUs. Our
quantization scheme focuses instead on improving the in-
ference speed vs accuracy tradeoff on mobile CPUs.
2. Quantized Inference
2.1. Quantization scheme
In this section, we describe our general quantization
scheme1 2, that is, the correspondence between the bit-
representation of values (denoted qbelow, for “quantized
value”) and their interpretation as mathematical real num-
bers (denoted rbelow, for “real value”). Our quantization
scheme is implemented using integer-only arithmetic dur-
ing inference and ﬂoating-point arithmetic during training,
with both implementations maintaining a high degree of
correspondence with each other. We achieve this by ﬁrst
providing a mathematically rigorous deﬁnition of our quan-
tization scheme, and separately adopting this scheme for
both integer-arithmetic inference and ﬂoating-point train-
ing.
1The quantization scheme described here is the one adopted in Tensor-
Flow Lite [ 5] and we will refer to speciﬁc parts of its code to illustrate
aspects discussed below.
2We had earlier described this quantization scheme in the documen-
tation of gemmlowp [ 18]. That page may still be useful as an alternate
treatment of some of the topics developed in this section, and for its self-
contained example code.

## Page 3

A basic requirement of our quantization scheme is that it
permits efﬁcient implementation of all arithmetic using only
integer arithmetic operations on the quantized values (we
eschew implementations requiring lookup tables because
these tend to perform poorly compared to pure arithmetic
on SIMD hardware). This is equivalent to requiring that the
quantization scheme be an afﬁne mapping of integers qto
real numbers r, i.e. of the form
r=S(q−Z) (1)
for some constants SandZ. Equation ( 1) is our quantiza-
tion scheme and the constants SandZare our quantization
parameters . Our quantization scheme uses a single set of
quantization parameters for all values within each activa-
tions array and within each weights array; separate arrays
use separate quantization parameters.
For8-bit quantization ,qis quantized as an 8-bit integer
(forB-bit quantization, qis quantized as an B-bit integer).
Some arrays, typically bias vectors, are quantized as 32-bit
integers, see section 2.4.
The constant S(for “scale”) is an arbitrary positive real
number. It is typically represented in software as a ﬂoating-
point quantity, like the real values r. Section 2.2describes
methods for avoiding the representation of such ﬂoating-
point quantities in the inference workload.
The constant Z(for “zero-point”) is of the same type
as quantized values q, and is in fact the quantized value q
corresponding to the real value 0. This allows us to auto-
matically meet the requirement that the real value r= 0be
exactly representable by a quantized value. The motivation
for this requirement is that efﬁcient implementation of neu-
ral network operators often requires zero-padding of arrays
around boundaries.
Our discussion so far is summarized in the following
quantized buffer data structure3, with one instance of such a
buffer existing for each activations array and weights array
in a neural network. We use C++ syntax because it allows
the unambiguous conveyance of types.
template<typename QType> // e.g. QType=uint8
struct QuantizedBuffer {
vector<QType> q; // the quantized values
float S; // the scale
QType Z; // the zero-point
};
2.2. Integer­arithmetic­only matrix multiplication
We now turn to the question of how to perform inference
using only integer arithmetic, i.e. how to use Equation ( 1)
to translate real-numbers computation into quantized-values
3The actual data structures in the TensorFlow Lite [ 5] Converter are
QuantizationParams andArray inthis header ﬁle . As we discuss
in the next subsection, this data structure, which still contains a ﬂoating-
point quantity, does not appear in the actual quantized on-device inference
code.computation, and how the latter can be designed to involve
only integer arithmetic even though the scale values Sare
not integers.
Consider the multiplication of two square N×Nma-
trices of real numbers, r1andr2, with their product repre-
sented by r3=r1r2. We denote the entries of each of these
matricesrα(α= 1,2or3) asr(i,j)
α for1/lessorequalslanti,j/lessorequalslantN,
and the quantization parameters with which they are quan-
tized as(Sα,Zα). We denote the quantized entries by q(i,j)
α.
Equation ( 1) then becomes:
r(i,j)
α=Sα(q(i,j)
α−Zα). (2)
From the deﬁnition of matrix multiplication, we have
S3(q(i,k)
3−Z3) =N/summationdisplay
j=1S1(q(i,j)
1−Z1)S2(q(j,k)
2−Z2),(3)
which can be rewritten as
q(i,k)
3=Z3+MN/summationdisplay
j=1(q(i,j)
1−Z1)(q(j,k)
2−Z2), (4)
where the multiplier Mis deﬁned as
M:=S1S2
S3. (5)
In Equation ( 4), the only non-integer is the multiplier M.
As a constant depending only on the quantization scales
S1,S2,S3, it can be computed ofﬂine. We empirically ﬁnd
it to always be in the interval (0,1), and can therefore ex-
press it in the normalized form
M= 2−nM0 (6)
whereM0is in the interval [0.5,1)andnis a non-negative
integer. The normalized multiplier M0now lends itself well
to being expressed as a ﬁxed-point multiplier (e.g. int16 or
int32 depending on hardware capability). For example, if
int32 is used, the integer representing M0is the int32 value
nearest to 231M0. SinceM0/greaterorequalslant0.5, this value is always at
least230and will therefore always have at least 30 bits of
relative accuracy. Multiplication by M0can thus be imple-
mented as a ﬁxed-point multiplication4. Meanwhile, multi-
plication by 2−ncan be implemented with an efﬁcient bit-
shift, albeit one that needs to have correct round-to-nearest
behavior, an issue that we return to in Appendix B.
2.3. Efﬁcient handling of zero­points

tion ( 4) without having to perform 2N3subtractions and

without having to expand the operands of the multiplication
into 16-bit integers, we ﬁrst notice that by distributing the
multiplication in Equation ( 4), we can rewrite it as

which takes 2N3arithmetic operations; indeed, everything
else involved in ( 7) isO(N2)with a small constant in the O.
Thus, the expansion into the form ( 7) and the factored-out
computation of a(k)
2and¯a(i)
1enable low-overhead handling
of arbitrary zero-points for anything but the smallest values
ofN, reducing the problem to the same core integer matrix
multiplication accumulation ( 9) as we would have to com-
pute in any other zero-points-free quantization scheme.
2.4. Implementation of a typical fused layer
We continue the discussion of section 2.3, but now ex-
plicitly deﬁne the data types of all quantities involved, and
modify the quantized matrix multiplication ( 7) to merge
the bias-addition and activation function evaluation directly
into it. This fusing of whole layers into a single operation
is not only an optimization. As we must reproduce in in-
ference code the same arithmetic that is used in training,
the granularity of fused operators in inference code (taking
an 8-bit quantized input and producing an 8-bit quantized
output) must match the placement of “fake quantization”
operators in the training graph (section 3).
For our implementation on ARM and x86 CPU ar-
chitectures, we use the gemmlowp library [ 18], whose
GemmWithOutputPipeline entry point provides sup-
ports the fused operations that we now describe5.
5The discussion in this section is implemented in TensorFlow Lite [ 5]
for e.g. a Convolutional operator ( reference code is self-contained, opti-
mized code calls into gemmlowp [ 18]).We take the q1matrix to be the weights, and the q2matrix
to be the activations. Both the weights and activations are
of type uint8 (we could have equivalently chosen int8, with
suitably modiﬁed zero-points). Accumulating products of
uint8 values requires a 32-bit accumulator, and we choose a
signed type for the accumulator for a reason that will soon
become clear. The sum in ( 9) is thus of the form:
int32 += uint8 *uint8. (10)
In order to have the quantized bias-addition be the addition
of an int32 bias into this int32 accumulator, the bias-vector
is quantized such that: it uses int32 as its quantized data
type; it uses 0 as its quantization zero-point Zbias; and its
quantization scale Sbiasis the same as that of the accumu-
lators, which is the product of the scales of the weights and
of the input activations. In the notation of section 2.3,
Sbias=S1S2, Zbias= 0. (11)
Although the bias-vectors are quantized as 32-bit values,
they account for only a tiny fraction of the parameters in a
neural network. Furthermore, the use of higher precision
for bias vectors meets a real need: as each bias-vector entry
is added to many output activations, any quantization error
in the bias-vector tends to act as an overall bias (i.e. an error
term with nonzero mean), which must be avoided in order
to preserve good end-to-end neural network accuracy6.
With the ﬁnal value of the int32 accumulator, there re-
main three things left to do: scale down to the ﬁnal scale
used by the 8-bit output activations, cast down to uint8 and
apply the activation function to yield the ﬁnal 8-bit output
activation.
The down-scaling corresponds to multiplication by the
multiplier Min equation ( 7). As explained in section 2.2, it
is implemented as a ﬁxed-point multiplication by a normal-
ized multiplier M0and a rounding bit-shift. Afterwards, we
perform a saturating cast to uint8 and to the range [0,255].
We focus on activation functions that are mere clamps,
e.g. ReLU, ReLU6. Mathematical functions are discussed
in Appendix A.1and we do not currently fuse them into
such layers. Thus, the only thing that our fused activation
functions need to do is to further clamp the uint8 value to
some sub-interval of [0,255] before storing the ﬁnal uint8
output activation. In practice, the quantized training pro-
cess (section 3) tends to learn to make use of the whole
output uint8 [0,255] interval so that the activation function
no longer does anything, its effect being subsumed in the
clamping to [0,255] implied in the saturating cast to uint8.
3. Training with simulated quantization
A common approach to training quantized networks is
to train in ﬂoating point and then quantize the resulting

in the TensorFlow Lite [ 5] Converter.

weights (sometimes with additional post-quantization train-
ing for ﬁne-tuning). We found that this approach works
sufﬁciently well for large models with considerable repre-
sentational capacity, but leads to signiﬁcant accuracy drops
for small models. Common failure modes for simple post-
training quantization include: 1) large differences (more
than100×) inranges of weights for different output chan-
nels (section 2mandates that all channels of the same layer
be quantized to the same resolution, which causes weights
in channels with smaller ranges to have much higher relative
error) and 2) outlier weight values that make all remaining
weights less precise after quantization.
We propose an approach that simulates quantization ef-
fects in the forward pass of training. Backpropagation still
happens as usual, and all weights and biases are stored in
ﬂoating point so that they can be easily nudged by small
amounts. The forward propagation pass however simu-
lates quantized inference as it will happen in the inference
engine, by implementing in ﬂoating-point arithmetic the
rounding behavior of the quantization scheme that we in-
troduced in section 2:
•Weights are quantized before they are convolved with
the input. If batch normalization (see [ 17]) is used for
the layer, the batch normalization parameters are “folded
into” the weights before quantization, see section 3.2.
•Activations are quantized at points where they would be
during inference, e.g. after the activation function is ap-
plied to a convolutional or fully connected layer’s output,
or after a bypass connection adds or concatenates the out-
puts of several layers together such as in ResNets.
For each layer, quantization is parameterized by the
number of quantization levels and clamping range, and is
performed by applying point-wise the quantization function
qdeﬁned as follows:
clamp(r;a,b):= min(max( x,a),b)
s(a,b,n):=b−a

quantization range, nis the number of quantization levels,
and⌊·⌉denotes rounding to the nearest integer. nis ﬁxed
for all layers in our experiments, e.g. n= 28= 256 for 8
bit quantization.
3.1. Learning quantization ranges
Quantization ranges are treated differently for weight
quantization vs. activation quantization:•For weights, the basic idea is simply to set a:= minw,
b:= maxw. We apply a minor tweak to this so that
the weights, once quantized as int8 values, only range
in[−127,127] and never take the value −128, as this en-
ables a substantial optimization opportunity (for more de-
tails, see Appendix B).
•For activations, ranges depend on the inputs to the net-
work. To estimate the ranges, we collect [a;b]ranges
seen on activations during training and then aggregate
them via exponential moving averages (EMA) with the
smoothing parameter being close to 1 so that observed
ranges are smoothed across thousands of training steps.
Given signiﬁcant delay in the EMA updating activation
ranges when the ranges shift rapidly, we found it useful
to completely disable activation quantization at the start
of training (say, for 50 thousand to 2 million steps). This
allows the network to enter a more stable state where ac-
tivation quantization ranges do not exclude a signiﬁcant
fraction of values.
In both cases, the boundaries [a;b]are nudged so that
value0.0is exactly representable as an integer z(a,b,n)
after quantization. As a result, the learned quantization pa-
rameters map to the scale Sand zero-point Zin equation 1:
S=s(a,b,n), Z=z(a,b,n) (13)
Below we depict simulated quantization assuming that
the computations of a neural network are captured as a Ten-
sorFlow graph [ 1]. A typical workﬂow is described in Al-

and removing operations is outside the scope of this pa-
per. Source code for graph modiﬁcations (inserting fake
quantization operations, creating and optimizing the infer-
ence graph) and a low bit inference engine has been open-
sourced with TensorFlow contributions in [ 19].

and after quantization for a simple convolutional layer. Il-
lustrations of the more complex convolution with a bypass
connection in ﬁgure C.3can be found in ﬁgure C.4.
Note that the biases are not quantized because they are
represented as 32-bit integers in the inference process, with
2708

a much higher range and precision compared to the 8 bit
weights and activations. Furthermore, quantization param-
eters used for biases are inferred from the quantization pa-
rameters of the weights and activations. See section 2.4.
Typical TensorFlow code illustrating use of [ 19] follows:

quantized_graph = qg. create_training_graph (g)
else:
quantized_graph = qg. create_eval_graph (g)
# Train or evaluate quantized_graph.
3.2. Batch normalization folding
For models that use batch normalization (see [ 17]), there
is additional complexity: the training graph contains batch
normalization as a separate block of operations, whereas
the inference graph has batch normalization parameters
“folded” into the convolutional or fully connected layer’s
weights and biases, for efﬁciency. To accurately simulate
quantization effects, we need to simulate this folding, and
quantize weights after they have been scaled by the batch
normalization parameters. We do so with the following:
wfold:=γw/radicalbig
σ2
B+ε. (14)
Hereγis the batch normalization’s scale parameter, σ2
Bis
the estimate of the variance of convolution results across the
batch, and εis just a small constant for numerical stability.
After folding, the batch-normalized convolutional layer
reduces to the simple convolutional layer depicted in ﬁg-
ure1.1a with the folded weights wfoldand the correspond-
ing folded biases. Therefore the same recipe in ﬁgure 1.1b
applies. See Appendix for the training graph (ﬁgure C.5) for
a batch-normalized convolutional layer, the corresponding
inference graph (ﬁgure C.6), the training graph after batch-
norm folding (ﬁgure C.7) and the training graph after both
folding and quantization (ﬁgure C.8).
4. Experiments
We conducted two set of experiments, one showcas-
ing the effectiveness of quantized training (Section. 4.1),
and the other illustrating the improved latency-vs-accuracy
tradeoff of quantized models on common hardware (Sec-
tion. 4.2). The most performance-critical part of the infer-
ence workload on the neural networks being benchmarked
is matrix multiplication (GEMM). The 8-bit and 32-bit
ﬂoating-point GEMM inference code uses the gemmlowp
library [ 18] for 8-bit quantized inference, and the Eigen li-
brary [ 6] for 32-bit ﬂoating-point inference.ResNet depth 50 100 150

[26])
4.1. Quantized training of Large Networks
We apply quantized training to ResNets [ 9] and Incep-
tionV3 [ 30] on the ImageNet dataset. These popular net-
works are too computationally intensive to be deployed on
mobile devices, but are included for comparison purposes.
Training protocols are discussed in Appendix D.1andD.2.
4.1.1 ResNets
We compare ﬂoating-point vs integer-quantized ResNets in
table 4.1. Accuracies of integer-only quantized networks
are within 2%of their ﬂoating-point counterparts.
We also list ResNet50 accuracies under different quan-
tization schemes in table 4.2. As expected, integer-only
quantization outperforms FGQ [ 26], which uses 2 bits for
weight quantization. INQ [ 33] (5-bit weight ﬂoating-point
activation) achieves a similar accuracy as ours, but we pro-
vide additional run-time improvements (see section 4.2).
4.1.2 Inception v3 on ImageNet
We compare the Inception v3 model quantized into 8 and 7
bits, respectively. 7-bit quantization is obtained by setting
the number of quantization levels in equation 12ton= 27.
We additionally probe the sensitivity of activation quantiza-
tion by comparing networks with ReLU6 and ReLU. The
training protocol is in Appendix D.2.
Table 4.3shows that 7-bit quantized training produces
model accuracies close to that of 8-bit quantized train-
ing, and quantized models with ReLU6 have less accuracy
degradation. The latter can be explained by noticing that
ReLU6 introduces the interval [0,6]as a natural range for
activations, while ReLU allows activations to take values
from a possibly larger interval, with different ranges in dif-

4.2. Quantization of MobileNets
MobileNets are a family of architectures that achieve a
state-of-the-art tradeoff between on-device latency and Im-
ageNet classiﬁcation accuracy. In this section we demon-
strate how integer-only quantization can further improve the
tradeoff on common hardware.
4.2.1 ImageNet
We benchmarked the MobileNet architecture with vary-
ing depth-multipliers (DM) and resolutions on ImageNet
on three types of Qualcomm cores, which represent three
different micro-architectures: 1) Snapdragon 835 LITTLE
core, (ﬁgure. 1.1c), a power-efﬁcient processor found in
Google Pixel 2; 2) Snapdragon 835 big core (ﬁgure. 4.1), a
high-performance core employed by Google Pixel 2; and 3)
Snapdragon 821 big core (ﬁgure. 4.2), a high-performance
core used in Google Pixel 1.

time budget. The accuracy gap is quite substantial ( ∼10%)
for Snapdragon 835 LITTLE cores at the 33ms latency
needed for real-time (30 fps) operation. While most of the
quantization literature focuses on minimizing accuracy loss
for a given architecture, we advocate for a more compre-
hensive latency-vs-accuracy tradeoff as a better measure.
Note that this tradeoff depends critically on the relative
speed of ﬂoating-point vs integer-only arithmetic in hard-
ware. Floating-point computation is better optimized in the
Snapdragon 821, for example, resulting in a less noticeable
reduction in latency for quantized models.
4.2.2 COCO
We evaluated quantization in the context of mobile real time
object detection, comparing the performance of quantized
8-bit and ﬂoat models of MobileNet SSD [ 10,25] on the
COCO dataset [ 24]. We replaced all the regular convolu-
tions in the SSD prediction layers with separable convolu-
tions (depthwise followed by 1×1projection). This modi-
ﬁcation is consistent with the overall design of MobileNets
and makes them more computationally efﬁcient. We uti-
lized the Open Source TensorFlow Object Detection API
[12] to train and evaluate our models. The training protocol
is described in Appendix D.3. We also delayed quantiza-
tion for500thousand steps (see section 3.1), ﬁnding that it
signiﬁcantly decreases the time to convergence.
Table 4.4shows the latency-vs-accuracy tradeoff be-
tween ﬂoating-point and integer-quantized models. Latency
was measured on a single thread using Snapdragon 835
cores (big and LITTLE). Quantized training and inference
results in up to a 50% reduction in running time, with a
minimal loss in accuracy ( −1.8%relative).
4.2.3 Face detection and attribute classiﬁcation
To better examine quantized MobileNet SSD on a smaller
scale, we benchmarked face detection on the face attribute

classiﬁcation dataset (a Flickr-based dataset used in [ 10]).
We contacted the authors of [ 10] to evaluate our quantized
MobileNets on detection and face attributes following the
same protocols (detailed in Appendix D.4).
Face detection : As indicated by tables 4.5and Ap-
pendix D.1, quantization provides close to a 2×latency
reduction with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 big or LIT-
TLE core at the cost of a ∼2%drop in the average pre-
cision. Notably, quantization allows the 25% face detector
to run in real-time ( 1K/28≈36fps) on a single big core,
whereas the ﬂoating-point model remains slower than real-
time (1K/44≈23fps).
We additionally examine the effect of multi-threading on
the latency of quantized models. Table Appendix D.1shows
a1.5to2.2×) speedup when using 4cores. The speedup ra-
tios are comparable between the two cores, and are higher
for larger models where the overhead of multi-threading oc-
cupies a smaller fraction of the total computation.
Face attributes : Figure 4.3shows the latency-vs-
accuracy tradeoff of face attribute classiﬁcation on the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. Since quantized training re-
sults in little accuracy degradation, we see an improved
tradeoff even though the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 is
highly optimized for ﬂoating point arithmetic (see Fig-wt.act.8 7 6 5 4

Ablation study To understand performance sensitivity
to the quantization scheme, we further evaluate quantized
training with varying weight and activation quantization bit
depths. The degradation in average precision for binary at-
tributes and age precision relative to the ﬂoating-point base-
line are shown in Tables 4.6and Appendix D.2, respec-
tively. The tables suggest that 1) weights are more sensi-
tive to reduced quantization bit depth than activations, 2)
8 and 7-bit quantized models perform similarly to ﬂoating
point models, and 3) when the total bit-depths are equal, it
is better to keep weight and activation bit depths the same.
5. Discussion
We propose a quantization scheme that relies only on
integer arithmetic to approximate the ﬂoating-point com-
putations in a neural network. Training that simulates the
effect of quantization helps to restore model accuracy to
near-identical levels as the original. In addition to the 4×
reduction of model size, inference efﬁciency is improved
via ARM NEON-based implementations. The improve-
ment advances the state-of-the-art tradeoff between latency
on common ARM CPUs and the accuracy of popular com-
puter vision models. The synergy between our quantiza-
tion scheme and efﬁcient architecture design suggests that
integer-arithmetic-only inference could be a key enabler
that propels visual recognition technologies into the real-
time and low-end phone market.
