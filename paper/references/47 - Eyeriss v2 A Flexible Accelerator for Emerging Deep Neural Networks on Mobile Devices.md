Abstract — A recent trend in deep neural network (DNN)
development is to extend the reach of deep learning applicationsto platforms that are more resource and energy-constrained, e.g.,mobile devices. These endeavors aim to reduce the DNN modelsize and improve the hardware processing efﬁciency and haveresulted in DNNs that are much more compact in their structures
and/or have high data sparsity . These compact or sparse models
are different from the traditional large ones in that there ismuch more variation in their layer shapes and sizes and oftenrequire specialized hardware to exploit sparsity for performanceimprovement. Therefore, many DNN accelerators designed forlarge DNNs do not perform well on these models. In this paper,we present Eyeriss v2, a DNN accelerator architecture designedfor running compact and sparse DNNs. To deal with the widelyvarying layer shapes and sizes, it introduces a highly ﬂexibleon-chip network, called hierarchical mesh, that can adapt to thedifferent amounts of data reuse and bandwidth requirementsof different data types, which improves the utilization of thecomputation resources. Furthermore, Eyeriss v2 can processsparse data directly in the compressed domain for both weightsand activations and therefore is able to improve both processingspeed and energy efﬁciency with sparse models. Overall, withsparse MobileNet, Eyeriss v2 in a 65-nm CMOS process achievesa throughput of 1470.6 inferences/s and 2560.3 inferences/J at a
batch size of 1, which is 12.6 ×faster and 2.5 ×more energy-
efﬁcient than the original Eyeriss running MobileNet.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The development of deep neural networks (DNNs) has
shown tremendous progress in improving accuracy over the
past few years [1]. In addition, there has been an increas-
ing effort to reduce the computational complexity of DNNs,particularly for those targeted at mobile devices [2]. Various
different techniques have been widely explored in the design
of DNN models including reduced precision of weights andactivations [3]–[8], compact network architectures [9]–[11]
(i.e., compact DNNs), and increasing sparsity in the ﬁlter

provide theoretical reductions in the size and number of
operations and storage cost, specialized hardware is often
necessary to translate these theo retical beneﬁts into measurable
improvements in energy efﬁciency and processing speed.
Support for reduced precision has been demonstrated in
recent hardware implementati ons, including Envision [15],
Thinker [16], UNPU [17], Loom [18], and Stripes [19].These works have shown various methods that efﬁciently
translate reduced bitwidth from 16-bits down to 1-bit into
both energy savings and increase in processing speed. Spe-
cialized hardware for binary networks have also been widely
explored [20]–[24]. In this work, we focus on complementaryapproaches that have been less explored, speciﬁcally the
support for diverse ﬁlter shapes for compact DNNs, as well
as support for processing in the compressed domain forsparse DNNs. While compact and sparse DNNs have fewer
operations and weights, they also introduce new challenges in
hardware design for DNN acceleration.
A. Challenges for Compact DNNs
The trend for compact networks is evident in how the
iconic DNNs have evolved over time. Early models, such
as AlexNet [25] and VGG [26], are now considered large
and over-parameterized. Techniques such as using deeper
but narrower network structures and bottleneck layers wereproposed to pursue higher accuracy while restricting the size
of the DNN (e.g., GoogLeNet [9] and ResNet [27]). This
quest further continued with a focus on drastically reducing theamount of computation, speciﬁ cally the number of multiply-
and-accumulates (MACs), and the storage cost, speciﬁcally the
number of weights. Techniques such as ﬁlter decomposition as
shown in Fig. 1 have since become popular for building com-
pact DNNs targeted at mobile devices (e.g., SqueezeNet [11]
and MobileNet [10]). This evolution has resulted in a more
diverse set of DNNs with widely varying shapes and sizes.
One effect of compact DNNs is that any data dimension
in a DNN layer can diminish . In addition, due to latency
constraints, it is increasingly d esirable to run DNNs at smaller
batch sizes (i.e., smaller N). Table I summarizes the data
dimensions that are used to describe a DNN layer and the
common reasons for each dimension to diminish. This sug-gests that less assumptions can be made on the dimensions of
a DNN layer.
For hardware designers, widely varying DNN layer shapes,
especially diminishing dimensions, is challenging as they

REASONS FOR DIMINISHING DATADIMENSIONS IN A DNN L AYER
result in changes in a key property of DNNs: data reuse ,
which is the number of MACs that use the same piece of data,
i.e., MACs/data. Most DNN accelerators rely on data reuse as ameans to improve efﬁciency. The amount of data reuse for each
of the three data types in a DNN layer, i.e., input activations
(iacts), weights and partial sums (psums), is a function of the
layer shape and size. For example, the amount of iact reuse is
proportional to the number of output channels as well as theﬁlter size in a layer. Therefore, diminished data dimensions
suggest that it is more difﬁcult to exploit data reuse from any
speciﬁc dimension.
Fig. 2 shows that the variatio n in data reuse increases in
all data types in more recent DNNs, and the amount of reuse
also decreases in iacts and psums. This variation and overall
reduction in data reuse makes the design of DNN accelerators
more challenging in two ways.
1) Array Utilization: Many existing DNN accelera-
tors [15]–[17], [29]–[32] rely on a set of pre-selected data
dimensions to exploit both high parallelism across an array
of processing elements (PEs) f or high performance and dataFig. 2. Data reuse of the three data t ypes in each layer of the three DNNs.
Each data point represents a layer, and the red point indicates the median

reuse for high energy efﬁciency. For instance, Fig. 3 shows
two designs that are commonly used. A spatial accumulation
array architecture (Fig. 3a), which is often used for a weight-
stationary dataﬂow, relies on both output and input channels
to map the operations spatially onto the PE array to exploit
parallelism. At the same time, each iact can be reused acrossthe PE array vertically with weights from different output
channels, while psums from the PEs in the same row can
be further accumulated spatially together before written backto the global buffer. Similarl y, a temporal accumulation array
architecture (Fig. 3b), which is often used for a output-
stationary dataﬂow, relies on another set of data dimensionsto achieve high compute parallelism. In this case, each iact is
still reused vertically across different PEs in the same column,
while each weight is reused horizontally across PEs in the
same row.
When the set of pre-selected data dimensions diminish due
to a change in DNN shapes and sizes, e.g., the number of
output channels in a layer ( M) is less than the height of
the PE array, efﬁciency decreases. Speciﬁcally, these spatial

mapping constraints result in both reduced array utilization
(i.e., fewer PEs are used) as well as lower energy efﬁciency.
Furthermore, these inefﬁciencies are magniﬁed as the size ofthe PE array is scaled up, because the diminished dimension
is even more likely to be unable to ﬁll the array. For example,
as shown in Fig. 4, the aforementioned spatial and temporalaccumulation arrays will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to fully utilize the
array due to the lack of input and output channels in the depth-
wise (DW) layers in MobileNet. In contrast, Eyeriss [33] can
still achieve high array utilization under such circumstances by
mapping the independent channe l groups onto different part of
the PE array due to the ﬂexibility of its Row-Stationary (RS)
dataﬂow.
2) PE Utilization: A lower data reuse also implies that a
higher data bandwidth is required to keep the PEs busy. If the
on-chip network (NoC) for data delivery to the PEs is designed
for high spatial reuse scenario s, e.g., a broadcast network,
the insufﬁcient bandwidth can lead to reduced utilization of
the PEs (i.e., increased stall cycles), which further reduces
accelerator performance. For instance, even though Eyeriss canbetter utilize the array as shown in Fig. 4, its broadcast NoC
(which supports multicast) is not going to provide adequate
bandwidth to support high throughput processing at high
parallelism, thus the performance will still suffer. However,
if the NoC is optimized for high bandwidth scenarios, e.g.,many unicast networks, it may not be able to take advantage
of data reuse when available.
An additional challenge lies in the fact that all DNNs
that the hardware needs to run will not be known at design
time [34]; as a result, the hardware has to be ﬂexible enough
to efﬁciently support a wide range of DNNs. To build a truly
ﬂexible DNN accelerator, the new challenge is to design an
architecture that can accommodate a wide range of shapes andsizes of DNN layers. In other words, the data has to be ﬂexibly
mapped spatially according to the speciﬁc shape and size of the
layer, instead of with a set of pre-selected dimensions, in orderto maximize the utilization of the PE array. Also, the data
delivery NoC has to be able to provide high bandwidth when
data reuse is low while still being able to exploit data reuse
with high parallelism when the opportunity presents itself.
B. Challenges for Sparse DNNs
Sparse activations naturally occur in DNNs for several
reasons. One is that many DNNs use the rectiﬁed linear
unit (ReLU) as the activation function, which sets negativevalues to zero; this sparsity tends to increase in deeper
layers and can go above 90%. Another increasingly impor-
tant reason is that many popular DNNs are in the form
of autoencoders [35]–[37] or generative adversarial net-works (GAN) [38], which contain decoder layers that use zero
insertion to up-sample the input feature maps, resulting in over
75% zeros.
There has also been a signiﬁcant amount of work to make
the weights in a DNN sparse. Various metrics are used to
decide which weights to prune (i.e., set to zero), including
saliency [12], magnitude [13], and energy consumption [14].
These pruned networks have weight sparsity of up to 90%.
Sparsity in weights and activations can be translated into
improved energy efﬁciency and processing speed in two ways:
(1) The MAC computation can be either gated or skipped; theformer reduces energy while the latter reduces both energy and
cycles. (2) The weights and act ivations can be compressed to
reduce the amount of storage and data movement; the former
reduces energy while the latter reduces both energy and cycles.
However, it is quite challenging to design DNN acceleratorsthat can actually harness these beneﬁts from sparsity due to
the following reasons:
1) Irregular Accesses Patterns: Computation gating can
effectively translate spars ity in both weights and activations
into energy savings, and its impl ementation can be realized at
a low cost by recognizing if either the weight or activation is
zero and gating the datapath switching and memory accesses
accordingly. For example, Eyeri ss has demonstrated gating for
sparse activations.
To improve throughput in addition to saving energy con-
sumption, it is desirable to skip the cycles of processing MACsthat have zero weights or iacts. However, this requires more
complex read logic as it must ﬁnd the next non-zero value
to read without wasting cycles reading zeros. A natural way
to address this issue is to keep the weights and iacts in a
compressed format that can indicate the location of the nextnon-zero relative to the current one. However, compressed
formats tend to be of variable l ength and thus must be accessed
sequentially. This makes it difﬁcult to divide up the com-pressed data for parallel processing across PEs without com-
promising compression efﬁciency. Furthermore, this presents
a challenge if sparsity in both weights and activation must be
simultaneously recognized, as it is difﬁcult to ‘jump ahead’
(e.g., skip non-zero weights when the corresponding iact iszero) for many of the most efﬁcient compression formats; the
irregularity introduced by jumping ahead also prevents the use
of pre-fetching as a means of improving throughput. Thus,the control logic to process the compressed data can be quite
complex and adds overhead to the PEs.
Accordingly, there has been limited hardware in this space.
Cnvlutin [39] only supports skipping cycles for activations
and does not compress the weights, while Cambricon-X [40]
does not keep activations in compressed form. Due to the
complexity of the logic to skip cycles for both weights
and activations, existing hardware for sparse processing is
typically limited to a speciﬁc layer type. For instance, EIE
targets fully-connected (FC) layers [41], while SCNN targets
convolutional (CONV) layers [42].

2) Workload Imbalance and PE Utilization: With compu-
tation skipping for sparse data, the amount of work to be
performed at each PE now depends on sparsity. Since the
number of non-zero values varies across different layers, datatypes, or even regions within the same ﬁlter or feature map,
it creates an imbalanced workload across different PEs and
the throughput of the entire DNN accelerator will be boundedby the PE that has the most non-zero MACs. This leads to a
decrease in PE utilization.
C. Contributions of This Work
To address these challenges, we present Eyeriss v2, a ﬂex-
ible architecture for DNN pr ocessing that can adapt to a
wide range of ﬁlter shapes and sizes used in compact DNNs
such as MobileNet. This is achieved through the design of
a highly ﬂexible on-chip network (NoC), which is currentlythe bottleneck for dealing with a more diverse set of DNNs.
In addition, Eyeriss v2 also supports sparse DNNs by exploit-
ing the sparsity in the weights a nd activations across a variety
of DNN layers and translates them into improvements in both
energy efﬁciency and processing speed. Finally, similar to theoriginal Eyeriss, Eyeriss v2 does not make any assumption
about whether the total storage capacity required by a DNN
layer can ﬁt on-chip or not; instead, it optimizes the way totile data of different types to achieve high on-chip reuse and
energy efﬁciency. In summary, the contributions of this paper
include:
A novel NoC, called hierarchical mesh, that is designed to
adapt to a wide range of bandwidth requirements. When
data reuse is low, it can provide high bandwidth (viaunicast) from the memory hierarchy to keep the PEs busy;
when data reuse is high, it can still exploit spatial data
reuse (via multicast or broadcast) to achieve high energy
efﬁciency. For a compact DNN such as MobileNet,
the hierarchical mesh increases the throughput by 5.6 ×
and energy efﬁciency by 1.8 ×. (Section III)
A PE that exploits the sparsity in weights and activations
to achieve improved throughput and energy efﬁciencyacross a variety of DNN layers. Data is kept in com-
pressed sparse column (CSC) format for both on-chip
processing and off-chip access to reduce storage and data
movement costs. Mapping of the weights to a PE is
performed by taking the sparsity into account to increasereuse within PE, and can therefore reduce the impact of
workload imbalance. Overall, exploiting sparsity results
in an additional 1.2 ×and 1.3 ×improvement in through-
put and energy efﬁciency, respectively, for MobileNet.
(Section IV)
A ﬂexible accelerator, Eyeri ss v2, that combines the
above contributions to efﬁciently support both compact
and sparse DNNs. Eyeriss v2 running sparse MobileNet
is 12.6 ×faster and 2.5 ×more energy efﬁcient than
the original Eyeriss (scaled to the same number of
PEs and storage capacity as Ey eriss v2), i.e., Eyeriss
v1, running MobileNet (49.2M MACs). Eyeriss v2 is
also 42.5 ×faster and 11.3 ×more energy efﬁcient with
sparse AlexNet compared to Eyeriss v1 running AlexNet

(724.4M MACs). Finally, Eyeriss v2 running sparse
MobileNet is 225.1 ×faster and 42.0 ×more energy efﬁ-
cient than Eyeriss v1 running AlexNet. It is evident that
supporting sparse and compact DNNs have a signiﬁcant
impact on speed and energy consumption. (Section V)
II. A RCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
Fig. 5 shows a comparison between the original Eyeriss [33]
and the Eyeriss v2 architecture. Similar to the original Eyeriss
architecture, Eyeriss v2 is composed of an array of processing
elements (PE), where each PE contains logi c to compute
multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) and local scratch pad (SPad)memory to exploit data reuse, and global buffers (GLB), which
serve an additional level of memory hierarchy between the PEs
and the off-chip DRAM. Therefore, both the original Eyeriss
and Eyeriss v2 have a two-level memory hierarchy. The main
difference is that Eyeriss v2 u ses a hierarchical structure,
where the PEs and GLBs are grouped into clusters in order
to support a ﬂexible on-chip network (NoC) that connects the
GLBs to the PEs at low cost; in contrast, the original Eyerissused a ﬂat multicast NoC between the GLB and PEs. As with
the original Eyeriss, Eyeriss v2 uses separate NoCs to transfer
each of the three data types, i.e., i nput activation (iact), weight,
and partial sums (psums), between the GLBs and PEs, with
each NoC tailored for the corresponding dataﬂow of that data
type. Details of the NoC are described in Section III.
Fig. 6 shows the top-level architecture of Eyeriss v2 and
Table II summarizes the components in the architecture. It con-sists of 16 PE clusters and 16 GLB clusters arranged in an 8 ×2
array. Each PE cluster contains 12 PEs arranged in a 3 ×4
array. Each GLB cluster has a capacity of 12 KB and consists

of SRAMs that are banked for different data types: iacts have
three banks, each of which is 1.5 kB, and psums have four
banks, each of which is 1.875 kB.
A hierarchical NoC is used to connect the PEs and GLBs:
the PE and GLB clusters are connected through 2D mesh
on-chip networks that consist of router clusters. Within each
router cluster, there are 3, 3, and 4 routers for iact, weight
and psum, respectively. Between the PE cluster and the router
cluster, an all-to-all NoC is used to connect all the PEs tothe routers for each data type. Between the GLB cluster and
the router cluster, each router is paired with a speciﬁc port
of the GLB cluster, which can read from and write to oneSRAM bank or off-chip I/O. Therefore, data from either
off-chip or a GLB cluster ﬁrst goes into the router cluster,
and then can be unicast to the local PE cluster, multicast to
PE clusters on the same row or column in the mesh network,
or broadcast to all PE clusters. The decision is based onthe shape and size of the DNN layer and the processing
dataﬂow. The design motivation and implementation details of
this hierarchical mesh networ k and the dataﬂow are described
in Section III.
The data movement through the two-level memory hierarchy
on Eyeriss v2 is as follows:
iacts are read from off-chip into the GLB cluster,
where they can be stored into the GLB memory or get
passed directly to the router cluster depending on theconﬁguration.
psums are always stored in the GLB memory once they
get out of the PE cluster. The ﬁnal output activationsskip the GLB cluster and go directly off-chip.
weights are not stored in GLB and get passed to the
router clusters and eventually stored in the SPads in each
PE directly.
Eyeriss v2 adopts the Row-Stationary (RS) dataﬂow [43] used
in the original Eyeriss, and further explores tiling the MACoperations spatially across PEs through any layer dimension,
including the channel group dimension ( Gin Table I). This is
especially important for layers such as the depth-wise (DW)CONV layers in MobileNet, which lacks the input and out-
put channels that are commonly used for spatial tiling and
therefore greatly improves the array utilization.
Each PE contains multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) data-
paths designed to process 8-bit ﬁxed-point iacts and weights,which is the commonly accepted b itwidth for inference. Since
many layers receive iacts after ReLU, the iacts can be set to
either signed or unsigned, which further extends the scale of

iact representation. Psums are accumulated at 20-bit precision,which has shown no accuracy impact in our experiments.
When the accumulation is done, the 20-bit psums are con-
verted back to 8-bit output activations and sent off-chip. The
PE contains separate SPads for iact, psum and weights. Details
of the PE architecture are described in Section IV.
Finally, Eyeriss v2 has a two-level control logic similar to
the original Eyeriss. The system-level control coordinates the
off-chip data accesses and data trafﬁc between the GLB andPEs, and the lower-level cont rol is within each PE and controls
the progress of processing of each PE independently. The chip
can be reconﬁgured to run the dataﬂow that maximizes the
energy efﬁciency and throughput for the processing of each
DNN layer. This includes setting up the speciﬁc data trafﬁcpattern of the NoCs, data accesses to the GLB and SPads, and
workload distribution for each PE. For each layer, a 2134-bit
command that describes the optimized conﬁguration is sent tothe chip and accessed statically throughout the processing of
this layer. Only one layer is processed at a time. When the
processing for a layer is done, the chip is reconﬁgured for theprocessing of the next layer.
III. F
LEXIBLE HIERARCHICAL MESH
ON-CHIPNETWORK
One of the key features required to support compact DNNs
is a ﬂexible and efﬁcient on-chip network (NoC). This sectionwill provide details on the implementation of the NoC in
Eyeriss v2 as well as describe how the NoC is conﬁgured
for various use cases.
A. Motivation
The NoC is an indispensable part of modern DNN acceler-
ators, and its design has to take the following factors into
consideration: (1) support processing with high parallelismby efﬁciently delivering data between storage and datapaths,
(2) exploit data reuse to reduce the bandwidth requirement
and improve energy efﬁciency, and (3) can be scaled at areasonable implementation cost.
Fig. 7 shows several NoC designs commonly used in DNN
accelerators. Due to the property of DNN that data reuse forall data types cannot be maximally exploited simultaneously,
a mixture of these NoCs is usually adopted for different data
types. For example, a DNN accelerator can use a 1D horizontal
multicast network to reuse the same weight across PEs in
the same row and a 1D vertical multicast network to reusethe same iact across PEs in the same column. This setup
will then require an unicast network that gathers the unique
output activations from each PE. T his combination, however,

implies that each weight needs to have the amount of reuse
with different iacts at least equal to the width of the PE array,and the number of iact reuse with different weights at least
equal to the height of the PE array. If these conditions are not
fulﬁlled, the PE array will not be fully utilized, which will
impact both throughput and energy efﬁciency.
While it was easy to satisfy such conditions with large
DNNs, the rise of compact DNN models has made this design
approach less effective. Th e key reason is that it is much
more difﬁcult to assume the amount of data reuse or requireddata bandwidth for each data type, as it will vary across
layers and DNN models. For example, the lack of input
or output channels in the depth-wise layers of MobileNet
or in the bottleneck layers of ResNet and GoogLeNet has
made it very difﬁcult to efﬁciently utilize the aforementionedexample well due to its rigid NoC design. In layers such
as fully-connected layers, commonly used in RNNs and
CNNs, it will also require a large batch size to improvethe amount of reuse for weights, which can be challenging
in real-time applications that are sensitive to the processing
latency.
The varying amount of data reuse for each DNN data
type across different layers or models pose a great challengeto the NoC design. The broadcast network can exploit the
most data reuse, but its low source bandwidth can limit
the throughput when data reuse is low. The unicast networkcan provide the most source bandwidth but misses out on
the data reuse opportunity when available. Taking the best
from both worlds, an all-to-all network that connects any
data sources to any destinations can adapt to the varying
amount of data reuse and bandwidth requirements. How-ever, the cost of its design increases quadratically with the
number of nodes, e.g., PEs, and therefore is difﬁcult to
scale up to the amount of parallelism required for DNNaccelerators.
B. High-Level Concept and Use Cases
To deal with this problem, we propose the hierarchical
mesh network (HM-NoC) in Eyeriss v2 as shown in Fig. 8a.
HM-NoC takes advantage of the all-to-all network, but solves
the scaling problem by creating a two-level hierarchy. The
all-to-all network is limited within the scope of a clusterat the lower level. In Eyeriss v2, there are only 12 PEs in
each cluster, which effectively reduce the cost of the all-to-all
network. At the top level, the clusters are further connectedwith a mesh network. While this example shows a 2 ×1m e s h ,
Eyeriss v2 uses a 8 ×2 mesh. Scaling up the architecture at the
cluster level with the mesh network is much easier than with
the all-to-all network since the implementation cost increases
linearly instead of quadratically.
Fig 8b to 8e shows how the HM-NoC can be conﬁgured into
four different modes depending on the data reuse opportunityand bandwidth requirements.
In the high bandwidth mode (Fig. 8b), each GLB bank
or off-chip data I/O can deliver data independently to the
PEs in the cluster, which achieves unicast .
In the high reuse mode (Fig. 8c), data from the same
source can be routed to all PEs in different clusters, which
achieves broadcast .
For situations where the data reuse cannot fully utilize the
entire PE array with broadcast, different multicast modes,
speciﬁcally grouped-multicast (Fig. 8d) and interleaved-
multicast (Fig. 8e), can be adopted according to the
desired multicast patterns.
Fig. 9 shows several example use cases of how HM-NoC
adapts different modes for different types of layers. For
simplicity, we are only showing a simpliﬁed case with 2 PE
clusters with 2 PEs in each cluster, and it omits the NoC forpsums. However, the same principles apply to NoC for all data
types and at larger scales.
Conventional CONV layers (Fig. 9a): In normal CONV
layers, there is plenty of data reuse for both iacts and
weights. To keep all 4 PEs busy at the lowest bandwidth
requirement, we need 2 iacts and 2 weights from the data
source (ignoring the reuse from SPad). In this case, either
the HM-NoC for iact or weight has to be conﬁguredinto the grouped-multicas t mode, while the other one
conﬁgured into the interleaved-multicast mode.
Depth-wise (DP) CONV layers (Fig. 9b): For DP CONV
layers, there can be nearly no reuse for iacts due to the
lack of output channels. Therefore, we can only exploit
the reuse of weights by broadcasting the weights to allPEs while fetching unique iacts for each PE.
Fully-connected (FC) layers (Fig. 9c): Contrary to theDP CONV layers, FC layers usually see little reuse
for weights, especially when the batch size is limited.
In this case, the modes of iact and weight NoCs areswapped from the previous one: the weights are now
unicast to the PEs while the iacts are broadcast to
all PEs.

C. Implementation Details
To support the various uses cases described in Section III-B,
each of the HM-NoC employs circ uit-switched routing, which
mainly consists of muxes and is statically conﬁgured by
the conﬁguration bits as described in Section II. Therefore,
the implementation cost of each router is very low. A separateHM-NoC is implemented for each data type (iact, psum,
and weights) that is tailored for their given dataﬂow. The
speciﬁcations of the routers f or each data type are summarized
in Table II. For iacts and weights, each port has a bitwidth
of 24 bits such that it can send and receive three 8b uncom-pressed iact values or two 12b compressed iact run-data pairs
per cycle. Section IV describes the compression format in
more detail. For psum, each port has a bitwidth of 40-bit tosend and receive two psums per cycle. We will now describe
how the routers, GLB and PEs are connected in the HM-NoC
for each data type.
1) HM-NoC for Input Activations: The HM-NoC imple-
mentation for iacts is shown in Fig. 10. There are three iact
routers per router cluster, one for each iact SRAM bank inthe GLB cluster. Each router for iact has four source ports
(to receive data) and four destination ports (to transmit data).
Three of the source and destination ports are used to receive
and transmit data from the other clusters in the mesh, which
are highlighted with bold arrows in Fig. 10; while a meshnetwork typically requires four pairs of source and destination
ports, we only require three pairs since we only have 8 ×2
clusters and thus either the east or west port can be omitted.The fourth source port connects to the GLB cluster to receive
data either from the memory bank or off-chip, and the fourth
destination port connects to all the V PEs in the cluster. Thanksto the all-to-all network in the PE cluster, data from any router
can go to any PE in the same cluster.
Fig. 11 shows the implementation details of the mesh
network router for iacts. It has four source (src) and four
destination (dst) ports. In addition to data ( d), each port
also has two additional signals, ready ( r) and enable ( e),
for hand-shaking. Each source port generates four enable
signals (e.g., e
00-e03), each for one destination port, basedFig. 10. Hierarchical mesh network f or input activations. This only shows

on its own enable signal and the statically conﬁgured routing
mode ( m). The routing mode can be one of the following:
unicast, horizontal multicast, vertical multicast, or broadcast.
It determines which ports can be enabled for passing data. For
example, in the horizontal multicast mode, ports that connectto other routers in the vertical direction of the mesh network
will not be enabled. At each destin ation port, the destination-
speciﬁc enable signals from all source ports (e.g., e
00-e30for
destination port 0) go through an OR gate to generate the ﬁnal
enable output. The ready signal from the destination ports
to the source ports are generated in a similar fashion with
the difference that the source-speciﬁc ready signals (e.g., r00-
r03for source port 0) go through an AND gate to generated
the ﬁnal ready output at each source port. The output data
from all source ports ( d0-d3) is MUXed at each destination
port, and is chosen based on the enable signals from the

source ports, i.e., the data from the enabled source port will
be passed through.
2) HM-NoC for Weights: The HM-NoC implementation for
weights is shown Fig. 12. There are three weight routers
per router cluster, one for each row of PEs within a cluster.
Since Eyeriss v2 uses the RS dataﬂow, a signiﬁcant amountof weight reuse can be exploited using the SPad within the
PE, and only spatial reuse across horizontal PEs needs to
be further exploited. Therefore, the implementation of the
NoC for the weights can be simpliﬁed at both levels of
the HM-NoC to reduce cost but still satisfy the ﬂexibilityrequirements. Speciﬁcally, the vertical connections of the 2D
mesh between the clusters can be removed. Furthermore,
within each cluster, each router only needs to connect to onerow of PEs. Accordingly, each weight router has two source
ports and two destination ports. A source port and a destination
port are used to receive and transmit weights coming from
neighboring cluster; again, we only need one pair of ports here
since we only have 8 ×2 clusters and thus either the east or
west port can be omitted. The second source port connects to
the GLB cluster to receive data from off-chip, while the second
destination port connects to one row of PEs within the cluster.The implementation of the mesh network router for weights
is similar to that in Fig. 11.
3) HM-NoC for Partial Sums: The HM-NoC implementa-
tion for psums is shown in Fig. 13. There are four psum routers
per router cluster, one for each psum SRAM bank in the GLB
cluster or, equivalently, one for each column of PEs within acluster. Similar to the weight NoC, the psum NoC is simpliﬁed
for its given dataﬂow; speciﬁcally, the psums are only allowed
to be accumulated across PEs in the vertical direction. This
is due to the fact that, in the row-stationary dataﬂow,
weights are reused across PEs horizontally, which makes it
impossible to accumulate psums across PEs horizontally. Thus,
the horizontal connections of the 2D mesh between the clusters
can be removed since psums won’t be passed horizontally.Within each cluster, the PEs ar e vertically connected and each
router in the cluster only needs to transmit the psum from
the psum bank in the GLB clu ster to the bottom of each PEFig. 13. Hierarchical mesh network for psums. This only shows the a 2 ×2
portion of the entire 8 ×2 cluster array.
column, and receive the updated psum from the top of the same
PE column. Accordingly, each psum router has three source
ports and three destination ports. One of the source ports
is used to receive data from the neighboring router cluster
to the north, while one of the destination ports is used to
transmit data to the neighboring router cluster to the south.The second pair of source and destination ports are assigned
to the psum bank in the GLB, while the third destination
port is assigned to the bottom PE in a column of the PEcluster and the third source port is assigned to the top PE in
a column of the PE cluster.
D. Scalability
A key design focus of the HM-NoC is to enable strong
scaling for Eyeriss v2. In other words, as the architecture
scales with more PEs, the performance, i.e., throughput, shouldscale accordingly for the sam e problem size. Performance,
however, is a function of many factors, including the dataﬂow,
NoC design, available on-chip and off-chip data deliverybandwidth, etc. To examine the impact of the HM-NoC,
we will assume no limitation on the off-chip bandwidth and
no workload imbalance (i.e., no sparsity) in the following
scalability experiments.
We proﬁle the performance of Ey eriss v2 at three different
scales: 256 PEs, 1024 PEs, and 16384 PEs, where each PE
is capable of processing at 1 MAC/cycle. The PE cluster
for all scales has a ﬁxed array size of 4 ×4P E s ,a n dt h e
number of PE clusters scales at 4 ×4,8×8, and 32 ×32. For
comparison, we also examine the scalability of the original
Eyeriss, i.e., Eyeriss v1, at the same set of scales. For Eyerissv1, the PEs are arranged in square arrays, i.e., 16 ×16,32×32,
and 128 ×128. Both versions of Eyeriss use the row-stationary
dataﬂow. For rapid evaluation of architectures at large scales,
we have built an analytical model that can search for the
operation mappings with the best performance at differentscales considering the data distribution and bandwidth lim-
itations of different NoC designs in the two versions of
Eyeriss.

AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet with a batch size of 1 at three different
scales. Note that the MobileNet model has a width multiplier of 1.0 and an
input size of 224 ×224, which is different from the MobileNet benchmarked
in Section V.
Fig. 14a and 14b show the normalized performance
of Eyeriss v2 and Eyeriss v1, respectively, running three
DNNs: AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet (with widthmultiplier of 1.0 and input size of 224 ×224)
1at the three
different scales with a batch size of 1. For all three DNNs,
the performance of Eyeris s v2 scales linearly from 256 to
1024 PEs, and achieves more than 85% of the linearly scaled
performance at 16384 PEs. In contrast, the performance of
Eyeriss v1 hardly improves when scaled up. This is due tothe insufﬁcient bandwidth provided by the broadcast NoC
in Eyeriss v1 as discussed in Section III-A. For example,
the performance of the FC layer s in AlexNet and depth-wise
layers in MobileNet do not see any improvement going from
256 PEs to 16384 PEs in Eyeriss v1 due to the insufﬁcientNoC bandwidth for delivering weights and input activation,
respectively, to the PEs. The HM-NoC in Eyeriss v2, how-
ever, is capable of adapting to the bandwidth requirements,therefore achieving higher performance at large scales. The
HM-NoC is doing so while still being able to exploit available
data reuse to achieve high energy efﬁciency, which will be
demonstrated in Section V-A and V-B. Also note that, at large
scales, the external data bandwidth will eventually becomethe performance bottleneck, and it will require more efforts
to integrate the accelerator into the system to harness its full
potential.
The implementation of the HM-NoC described in
Section III-C targets the size of 8 ×2 PE clusters, and will
require modiﬁcations when s caled up. Speciﬁcally, the mesh
routers for input activations and weights need an extra pair of
source and destination ports in order to handle data deliveryfor more than two columns of PE clusters. As the area and
energy cost of the router grows with the number of ports,
the overall cost will increase. However, the same routers can
then be used for any architectural scales. Also, as will be
shown in Section V, the entire NoC only accounts for less than
3% of the area and 6%-10% of the total energy consumption.
The additional complexity in the routers is unlikely to add
signiﬁcant cost. In addition, the proportion of cost of differentcomponents will stay roughly constant as the system scales
thanks to the design of the hierarchical mesh network.
1The large MobileNet model used here is not used for performance and
energy efﬁciency benchmarking in Section V since the post-place-and-route
simulation turn-around time is not prac tical; the smaller MobileNet model
also has the same accuracy as AlexNet, which makes it a better comparison.Fig. 15. Processing in the PE.
IV . S PARSE PROCESSING WITHSIMD S UPPORT
In the original Eyeriss, sparsity of input activations (iacts),
i.e., zeros, is exploited to improve energy efﬁciency by gating
the switching of logic and data accesses. In Eyeriss v2,
we want to exploit sparsity further in both weights and iacts
and improve not only energy efﬁciency but also throughput.
Whereas the original Eyeriss only used compression between
the GLB and off-chip DRAM, in Eyeriss v2, we keep thedata in compressed form all the way to the PE. Processing
in the compressed domain provides beneﬁts in terms of
reducing on-chip bandwidth requirements as well as on-chip
storage, which can result in energy savings and throughput
improvements. However, as compressed data often has variablelength, this presents challenges in terms of how to manipulate
the data (e.g., distributing data across PEs, and sliding window
processing within the PE). In this section, we will introduce anew PE architecture that can process sparse data in the com-
pressed domain for higher throughput. We will also introduce
support for SIMD in the PE such that each PE can process
two MACs per cycle.
A. Sparse PE Architecture
Fig. 15 illustrates how the PE processes uncompressed
weights and iacts in the original Eyeriss, where M0a n d C0
are the output and input channels processed within the PE, S
is the ﬁlter width, and Uis the stride. Recall that for the
row-stationary dataﬂow, multiple 1-D rows of weights and
iact are mapped to a given PE and processed in a sliding
window fashion; here, the C0×M0 rows of weights with
width Sare assigned to the PE, and the weights belong to M0
output channels and C0 input channels. For each iact, the PE
runs through M0 MAC operations sequentially in consecutive
cycles with the corresponding column of M0 weights in the
weight matrix, and accumulates to M0 partial sums (psums).
By going through a window of C0×Siacts in the stream,
the processing goes through all M0×C0×Sweights in the
matrix and accumulates to the same M0 psums. It then slides
to the next window in the iact stream by replacing C0×U
iacts at the front of the window with new ones, and repeats
the processing with the same wei ght matrix but accumulates to
another set of psums. Note that the access pattern of weights
goes through the entire weight matrix once sequentially in a
column-major fashion for each window of iacts.

To speed up the processing when the iacts and/or weights
are sparse, the goal is to read only the non-zero data in the
iact stream and the weight matrix for processing. In addition,
we only want to perform the read when both iact and weights
are non-zero. The challenge, however, is to correctly and
efﬁciently address data for all three data types. For example,
when jumping between non-zero iacts in a window, the accesspattern of weights does not go through the weight matrix
sequentially anymore. Instead, additional logic is required to
fetch the corresponding column of weights for the non-zero
iact, which is not deterministic. Similarly, when jumping
between non-zero weights in a weight column, it also has tocalculate the address of the corresponding psum instead of
just incrementing the addres s by one. Since the access order
is also not deterministic, prefetching from the weight SPad isvery challenging.
In order to achieve the processing of sparse data as described
above, we take advantage of the compressed sparse col-
umn (CSC) compression format similar to what is described
in [41], [44]. For each non-zero value in the data, the CSCformat records a count value that indicates the number of
leading zeros from the previous non-zero value in the uncom-
pressed data stream; this is similar to the run length in runlength coding (RLC). The count value can then be used to
calculate the address change between the non-zero data. The
added advantage of CSC over RLC is that it has an additional
address value that allows the data to be broken into segments
(e.g., columns) for easy handling, which we will discuss next;this, of course, also adds overhead in the compression.
Both the iact and weights are encoded in the CSC format.
For iacts, the data stream is divided into non-overlapping C0×
Usegments, and each segment is CSC encoded separately.
Doing so enables sliding wi ndow processing, which replaces
a segment of data with a new one from the stream when the
window slides. Since the data length of each segment will be
different after CSC coding, additional information is neededto address each encoded segment. Therefore, for each encoded
segment, an address value is also recorded in the CSC format
that indicates the start address of the encoded segment in theentire encoded stream. The ﬁlter weights are also encoded with
CSC compression by dividing each column of M0 weights as
a segment and encoding each segment separately. This helps
enable fast access of each column of non-zero weights.
Fig. 16 shows an example of CSC compressed weights.
The characters in the weight matrix indicate the locations
of non-zero values. To read the non-zero weights from a
speciﬁc column, e.g., column 1 (assuming indexing startsfrom 0), the PE ﬁrst reads address[1] and address[2] from
the address vector in the CSC compressed weights, which
gives the inclusive lower bound and non-inclusive upper boundof the addresses, i.e., 2 and 5, respectively, for reading the
data and count vector. The ﬁrst address (in this example,
address[1]) is the location of the ﬁrst non-zero weight in each
column, highlighted in bold in Fig. 16, within the data vector;
it then goes through the three non-zero weights in the column,i.e., c,dand e, to perform the computation. If there is no
non-zero weight in a column, the location of the next ﬁrst
non-zero value is repeated (e.g., since there are no non-zeroFig. 16. Example of compressing spar se weights with compressed sparse
column (CSC) coding. The ﬁrst non-zero weight in each column is highlightedin bold; the address vector points to the location of these weights within
the data vector. If there are no non-zero weights in a column next location
is repeated (e.g., repeated 6 in address vector reﬂects the all zero columnbetween fandg).
values in column 3, the value 6 which is the location of g,
is repeated such that the difference in consecutive address
values is zero, which reﬂects the all zero column.). At the
same time, the corresponding addresses of the psums to updatecan be calculated by accumulating the counts from the count
vector.
In the CSC format, the count vector is an overhead in
addition to the non-zero data. If the bitwidth of the count is
low, it may affect the compression efﬁciency when sparsity
is high since the number of consecutive zeros can exceed
the maximum count. If the count bitwidth is high, however,
the overhead of the count vector becomes more signiﬁcant.From our experiments, settin g each count at 4b yields the
best compression rate for the 8b iact and weights. Therefore,
each count-data pair is 12b and is stored in a 12b word ofthe data SPad for both iact and weight. This is similar to
setting the run-length in the RLC, where 5b was allocated to
the run-length in [33].
In summary, both the weights and iacts can be processed
directly in the CSC format. The processing can skip the zeros
entirely without spending extra cycles, thus improving the
processing throughput as well as energy efﬁciency.
Fig. 17 shows the block diagram of the sparse PE that
can perform the processing of CSC encoded iacts and weights
directly as described above. Processing only non-zero data
in the compressed format introduces read dependencies. For
the compressed format, the address must be read before the
data-count pair. To ensure only non-zero values are read, iactis read before the weight such that a non-zero weight is only
read when the corresponding iact is non-zero. To handle these
dependencies while still ma intaining thr oughput, the PE is
implemented using seven pipeline stages and ﬁve SPads. The
ﬁrst two pipeline stages are responsible for fetching non-zero
iacts from the SPads. The iact address SPad stores the addressvector of the CSC compressed iacts, which is used to address
the reads from the iact data SPad that holds the non-zero data
vector as well as the count vector. After a non-zero iact is
fetched, the next three pipeline stages read the corresponding
weights. Similarly, there is a weight address SPad to addressthe reads from the weight data SPad for the correct column
of weights. The ﬁnal two stages in the pipeline perform the
MAC computation on the fetched non-zero iact and weight,

and then send the updated psum either back to the psum SPad
or out of the PE.
Since either iact and weight can be zero or non-zero, there
are three possible scenarios:
If the iact is zero , the CSC format will ensure that it is not
read from the spad and therefore no cycles are wasted.
If the iact is not zero , its value will be fetched from the
iact data SPad and passed to the next pipeline stage.
–If there are non-zero weights corresponding to the
non-zero iacts , they will be passed down the pipeline
for computation. The zero weights will be skippedsince the weights are also encoded with the CSC
format.
–If there are no non-zero weights corresponding to the
non-zero iacts , the non-zero iacts will not be further
passed down in the pipeline. This may not necessar-
ily introduce bubbles in the pipeline since the later
stages, i.e., after the weight data Spad stage, can still
be working on the computation for the previous non-zero iact if it has multiple corresponding weights.
In the Eyeriss v2 PE, the sizes of the iact address and data
SPads are 9 ×4b and 16 ×12b, respectively, which allow
for a maximum iact window size of 16. The sizes of the
weight address and data SPads are 16 ×7b and 96 ×24b,
respectively. This allows for a maximum weight matrix size
of 96 ×(24b/12b)=192. The size of the psum SPad is
32×20b, and allows for a maximum weight matrix height
of 32 (i.e., maximum number of output channels M0). If we
fully utilize the iact SPads and psum SPad, it will require aweight matrix size of 32 ×16=512, which is larger than the
limit of 192; however, the sparse PE design takes advantage
of the fact that the sparse pattern of weights is known atcompile time; therefore, it is possible to guarantee that the
compressed weights will ﬁt in a smaller SPad. Table III shows
how many weights are stored in the SPad of each PE forsparse AlexNet. While in most layers the nominal number of
weights is higher than 192, the number of non-zero weights
after compression in the worst case is smaller and ﬁts in the
SPad for processing. By mapping more non-zero weights into
each PE instead of mapping based on the nominal numberof weights, more operations are performed in a PE, which
statistically helps to reduce the amount of workload imbalance
caused by the sparsity.TABLE III
DISTRIBUTION OF WEIGHTS IN SPARSE ALEXNET TO THE SPAD
INEACH PE OFEYERISS V 2
Since the degree of sparsity varies across different DNNs
and data types, the PE is also designed to adapt to the scenarios
when sparsity is low. In such cases, the PE can directly
take in uncompressed iacts and weights instead of the CSC
compressed versions to reduce the overhead in data trafﬁc.
Both iact and weight address SPads are not used and thereforeclock-gated to save energy consumption, and the count in the
CSC format is ﬁxed to zero to address the data SPads correctly
for processing.
B. SIMD Support in PE
Proﬁling results of the PE implementation shows that the
area and energy consumption of the MAC unit is insigniﬁcant
compared to other components in a PE. In Eyeriss, forexample, the MAC unit takes less than 5% of the PE area,
and only consumes 2%–9% of the PE power. This motivates
the exploration of SIMD processing in a PE in order to achieve
speedup of at most two times.
SIMD is applied to the PE architecture as shown in Fig. 17
by fetching two weights instead of one for computing two
MAC operations per cycle with the same iact, i.e., a SIMD
width of two. The changes are noted in the red text in theﬁgure. SIMD processing not only improves the throughput but
also further reduces the number of iact reads from the SPad.
In terms of architectural changes, SIMD requires the word
width of the weight data SPad to be two-word wide, which
is why the size of the weight data SPad is 96 ×24b instead
of 192 ×12b. The psum SPad also has to have two read and
two write ports for updating two psums per cycle. In the case
where only an odd number of non-zero weights exist in thecolumn of M0 weights, the second 12b of the last 24b word
in a column of non-zero weights is ﬁlled with zero. When
the PE logic encounters the all-zero count-data pair, it clock-
gates the second MAC datapaths as well as the read and write
of the second ports in the psum SPad to avoid unnecessaryswitching, which reduces power consumption.

dataset [1], and (3) a batch size of one, which represents a
more challenging setup for energy efﬁciency and throughput,
but captures the low latency use case.
The overall gate count of Eyeriss v2, excluding SRAMs,
is approximately 2695k NAND-2 gates. The area breakdown
(Fig. 18) shows that the 192 PEs dominates the area cost,
while the area of the hierarchical mesh networks of all datatypes combined only account for 2.6% of the area. This result
proves that it is possible to build in high ﬂexibility at a low
cost. Within each PE, all of th e SPads combined account for
around 72% of the area, while the two MAC units only account
for 5%.
A. Performance Analysis
To demonstrate the throughput and energy efﬁciency
improvements brought on by the hierarchical mesh network
and sparse PE architecture, we have implemented three dif-ferent variants of Eyeriss: v1, v1.5, and v2. Table V lists
the key differences between these Eyeriss variants. For the
PE architecture, Dense means the PE can only clock-gate the
cycles with zero data but not skip it, while Sparse means
the PE can further skip the processing cycles with zero data.
Eyeriss v1 is the same design as the original Eyeriss [33], butwith the storage capacity, number of PEs and data precision
scaled to the same level as v1.5 and v2 for a fair comparison.
In short, the comparison between v1 and v1.5 shows the
impact of the hierarchical mesh network, while the comparison
between v1.5 and v2 shows the impact of the sparse PEarchitecture along with the support for SIMD processing.
These architectures are placed -and-routed and benchmarked

of 0.5 and input size of 128 ×128) [10], and the sparse version
of them as pruned by the method introduced in [14]. In this
section, unless otherwise speciﬁed, AlexNet and MobileNet
are referring to the dense model.
The implementation shows that Eyeriss v2 has an area
increase of around two times compared to the other versions.
The increase in mostly in the PE, which is 73% larger than
the original one. The main reason is due to the need to
support sparse processing, which requires deeper pipeliningin the control logic and additional SPads to store the CSC
compressed data. This contributes to a nearly 50% increase in
area. Supporting SIMD also contributes to an additional 15%area increase due to the two sets of read and write ports for the
psum SPad and the wider bus-width of the PE I/O in addition
to the doubling of MAC units.
1) AlexNet: Fig. 19a shows the throughput improvements
of different versions of Eyeriss on AlexNet over Eyeriss v1.
Results on sparse AlexNet are also included (yellow bars)along with a breakdown of the processing latency across the
different layers shown in Fig. 20. For AlexNet, the result
shows that Eyeriss v1.5 signiﬁcantly speeds up FC layers.
This is because the throughput of FC layers is bandwidth-
limited in Eyeriss v1, which is addressed by the hierarchicalmesh network in Eyeriss v1.5. Eyeriss v2, on the contrary,
signiﬁcantly speeds up the CONV layers over Eyeriss v1.5 due
to the increased number of multipliers and sparsity in theactivations. However, the throughput of the FC layers only
shows a marginal improvement because the FC layers are still
bandwidth-limited even with the hierarchical mesh network.
Therefore, speeding up the pro cessing with sparsity and SIMD
does not improve the throughput of FC layers as signiﬁcantlyas in CONV layers.
The full potential of Eyeriss v2, however, is fully revealed
when coupled with sparse AlexNet. The bandwidth require-ment of weights is lower in sparse AlexNet since it is very
sparse, and the CSC compression can effectively reduce the
data trafﬁc. As a result, exploiting sparsity becomes moreeffective. Overall, Eyeriss v2 achieves 42.5 ×speedup with
sparse AlexNet over Eyeriss v1 with AlexNet.
Fig. 19b shows the improvement on energy efﬁciency.
It largely correlates to the speedup in Fig. 19a since the higher
overall utilization of the PEs r educes the proportion of the
static power consumption, e.g., clock network. Overall, Eyeriss
v2 with sparse AlexNet is 11.3 ×more energy efﬁcient than
Eyeriss v1 with AlexNet.

AlexNet running on Eyeriss v2.
2) MobileNet (Width Multiplier of 0.5, Input Size of 128 ×
128):Fig. 21a and 21b show the improvement on throughput
and energy efﬁciency, respectively, of different versions of
Eyeriss on selected layers of MobileNet over Eyeriss v1.
Results on sparse MobileNet are also included (yellow bars).The lack of data reuse in MobileNet results in low throughput
on Eyeriss v1 due to the low-bandwidth NoC, which is
why Eyeriss v1.5 can achieve a signiﬁcant speedup over v1.However, the speedup of Eyeriss v2 over v1.5 is a mixed bag.
While layers such as CONV1 and the point-wise (PW) layers
can still take advantage of the sparsity in input activations
to improve the throughput, the throughput of the Depth-
wise (DW) CONV layers becomes worse. This is because theCSC compression does not create skippable cycles when the
number of input and output channe ls are both one. Therefore,
the sparse PE in Eyeriss v2 does not bring any advantage overthe dense PE in Eyeriss v1.5. Furthermore, the deeper pipeline
of the sparse PE actually makes the throughput slightly worse
in the DW CONV layers.
Sparse MobileNet brings additional beneﬁts on throughput
and energy efﬁciency on Eyeriss v2; however, the improve-ment is not as signiﬁcant as with the sparse AlexNet, since
the CSC compression is less effective on sparse MobileNet
than on sparse AlexNet due to its small layer sizes. Overall,Eyeriss v2 with sparse MobileNet is 12.6 ×faster and 2.5 ×
more energy efﬁcient than Eyeriss v1 with MobileNet.
B. Benchmark Results
Table VI summarizes the throughput and energy efﬁciency
of Eyeriss v2 benchmarked with four DNNs that have com-
parable accuracy at a batch size of one. Although Eyerissv2 achieves the highest GOPS/W
2with sparse AlexNet, it con-
sumes the least amount of time and energy per inference
2In this paper, we calculate GOPS based on the nominal number of
operations in the DNN, i.e., including operations with data values of zero.with the sparse MobileNet. This result echoes the trend of
DNN development going toward compact models that are
more lightweight but also have less reuse for the hardware to
explore, which makes it harder to reduce GOPS/W but can stillimprove inference/J . Also, Eyeriss v2 achieves 12.6 ×higher
inference/sec for MobileNet than AlexNet, which correlates
well to the 14.7 ×reduction in the nominal number of MACs.
This proves that the design has high ﬂexibility to perform well
for compact DNN models.
Fig. 22 shows the normalized power breakdown of Eyeriss
v2 running a variety of DNN layers. We pick a representative
set of layers to show how the different characteristics of theDNN layers impact the hardware. Note that these layers have
different energy consumption and efﬁciency. The results are
summarized as follows:
CONV1 of AlexNet (148.1 GOPS/W) shows the case ofno sparsity in both activations and weights. Compared
to other layers, the high utilization of the PEs makes
the proportion of the clock network power consumptionlow. It also has the highest proportion of MAC power
consumption.
CONV3 of sparse AlexNet (1423.2 GOPS/W) has thehighest amount of sparsity in all layers we have tested.
Compared to CONV3 of AlexNet (392.0 GOPS/W),the proportions of the clock network, HM-NoC and
GLB power consumption are higher. This is mainly due
to the workload imbalance induced by sparsity, whichlowers the utilization of the active PEs. However, judging
from the large proportion of the SPad and MAC power
consumption compared to other components such as PE
control logic, the PE is still kept fairly busy and data
reuse is effectively exploited by the SPads.
CONV13 DW layer of MobileNet (77.7 GOPS/W) has
the lowest GOPS/W among all the layers we have tested.
As expected, most of the energy is spent on the clocknetwork. Inside the PE, the lack of reuse and not being
able to utilize SIMD also hurt the energy efﬁciency, which
is evident by the fact that most of the energy is spent inthe control logic instead of the SPads or MACs.
FC8 of sparse AlexNet (465.1 GOPS/W) shows the caseof high sparsity and low data reuse. This combina-
tion makes the architecture more bandwidth-limited, and
therefore the utilization of active PEs becomes low. Thatis why this layer has the highest proportion of power
consumed by the clock network. The lack of reuse also
makes the proportion of the SPad power consumption low

and the NoC power consumption high. However, thanks
to sparsity, the overall energy efﬁciency of this layer isstill better than CONV1 of AlexNet.
In terms of external DRAM accesses, AlexNet requires
much more data than MobileNet as shown in Table VI, which
is mainly due to the large amount of weights in the fully-
connected layers. For CONV layers only, the required DRAM
accesses are 7.1 MB and 4.6 MB for AlexNet and sparseAlexNet, respectively. Note that Eyeriss v2 does not perform
the pooling layers on-chip, and the required DRAM accesses
will further decrease if pooling l ayers are processed on-chip.
We have also proﬁled the impact of a limited peak external
bandwidth on the performance. With an aggregated external
read and write bandwidth of 25600 MB/s, which is at the levelof DDR4-3200, the throughput of Eyeriss v2 running sparse
AlexNet and sparse MobileNet will decrease by 16% and 24%,
respectively, due to the bursty external data access patterns.
However, we believe that additional on-chip buffering can
alleviate the performance degradation, which we will leave forfuture endeavors. This result also conﬁrms that, with efﬁcient
hardware that can maximize utilization even when data reuse
is low, DNNs that do not have enough data reuse to exploitwill put more pressure on the external data bandwidth, which
should be addressed in the design of future DNN models.
C. Comparison With Prior Art
Table VII shows the comparison between Eyeriss v2 and
the state-of-the-art prior art. Eyeriss v2 is the ﬁrst one to
report benchmark results on both large DNNs, e.g., AlexNet,
and compact DNNs, e.g., MobileNet. For AlexNet, Eyeriss
v2 still achieves comparabl e throughput and slightly less
energy efﬁciency compared to other works that are tailored
for the large models. This result is achieved with a batch size
of one (while other results use larger batch sizes), and theoverhead associated with its additional ﬂexibility to handle
the drastically different layer shapes in the compact models.
We report results for Eyeriss v2 on a sparse network which is
a widely used approach for large DNN models, particularly
on mobile devices; unfortunately, the available results forthe other works are only on AlexNet. We would expect
the sparse AlexNet to potentially provide additional energy
efﬁciency improvements on those works, but not throughputimprovements.
For MobileNet, Eyeriss v2 achieves 5.3 ×throughput
improvement and 3.9 ×energy improvement over AlexNet,
with the same accuracy. Although the other designs do not
report results for MobileNet, our understanding of thosedesigns leads us to believe that they would not achieve compa-
rable improvements, similar to the original Eyeriss, due to the
NoC limitations as well as additional mapping inefﬁciencies ofthe dataﬂow. However, we conjecture that the NoC limitations
can be addressed by the proposed HM-NoC.
D. Discussion
Eyeriss v2 focuses its design on improving the throughput
and energy efﬁciency for compact and sparse DNN models,

COMPARISON WITHSTATE -OF-THE-ARTDESIGNS .FOREYERISS V 2,THE THROUGHPUT AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ARE BENCHMARKED
ON THE SPARSE VERSION OF ALEXNET AND MOBILE NET
which is very different from the direction taken in many of
the state-of-the-art previous works. With a similar amount
of resources, i.e., area, Eyeriss v2 has much fewer number
of MACs. However, with the ﬂexibility of the on-chip net-
work and the sparse processing logic that effectively improvethroughput based on the sparsity of the data, Eyeriss v2 still
achieves comparable throughput and energy efﬁciency for
large DNNs against the state-of-the-art that optimizes directlyfor them. Furthermore, Eyeriss v2 shows a signiﬁcant through-
put and energy efﬁciency improvement on sparse MobileNet
against Eyeriss v1 as shown in Section V-A.
Supporting sparse processing is a challenging task from
an architecture design point of view. First of all, the PE
design complexity and cost becomes much higher due to the
additional required logic and storage. This has resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase in area as shown in Table V. In addition,it makes the support for high SIMD width processing difﬁcult
because of the workload imbal ance and the high cost in the
SPad due to the non-determinis tic access patterns. Eyeriss
v2, however, still demonstrates a design that can effectively
translate the sparsity to signiﬁcant throughput and energy
efﬁciency improvement as compared to Eyeriss v1.
It is worth noting that the ﬂexibility provided by the
hierarchical mesh network and the throughput boost from thesparse processing logic can be applied separately. Therefore,
if sparse networks are not the target workload, the ﬂexible NoC
can still be used in conjunction with other techniques suchas lower precision and higher parallelism to achieve higher
throughput and energy efﬁciency.
VI. C
ONCLUSION
DNNs are rapidly evolving due to the signiﬁcant amount
of research in the ﬁeld; however, the current direction of
DNN development also brings new challenges to the design
of DNN accelerators due to the widely varying layer shapes in
compact DNNs and the varying data sparsity in sparse DNNs.
In this work, we propose a new DNN accelerator architec-ture, called Eyeriss v2, that addresses these challenges. First,
the varying layer shapes makes the on-chip network (NoC)
the performance bottleneck since conventional NoC designposes strong assumptions on the amount of data reuse and
required data bandwidth for each data type, which is too rigid
to adapt. We solve this problem by introducing the hierarchical
mesh network (HM-NoC). HM-NoC can be conﬁgured into
different modes that can deliver from high bandwidth to highdata reuse. More importantly, its implementation cost is also
minimized through the hierarchical design that limit the costly
all-to-all communication within local clusters as well as thecircuit-switched routing. This helps to bring over an order of
magnitude speedup for processing MobileNet compared to the
original Eyeriss, i.e., Eyeriss v1, scaled to the same number ofmultipliers and storage capacity as Eyeriss v2. Furthermore,
Eyeriss v2 incorporates a new PE architecture that support
processing sparse weights and input activations directly in
compressed domain to improve not only energy efﬁciency but
also throughput. It also adds SIMD support so that each PEcan process 2 MACs per cycles. Overall, Eyeriss v2 achieves
42.5 ×and 11.3 ×improvement in throughput and energy
efﬁciency, respectively, with sparse AlexNet compared toEyeriss v1 running AlexNet; it also achieves 12.6 ×and 2.5 ×
improvement in throughput and energy efﬁciency, respec-
tively, with sparse MobileNet compared to Eyeriss v1 running
MobileNet.
