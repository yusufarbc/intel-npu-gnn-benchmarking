Abstract
Deploying large language models on-device for always-on personal agents demands
sustained inference from hardware tightly constrained in power, thermal envelope,
and memory. We benchmark Qwen 2.5 1.5B (4-bit quantised) across four platforms:
a Raspberry Pi 5 with Hailo-10H NPU, a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, an iPhone 16
Pro, and a laptop NVIDIA RTX 4050 GPU. Using a fixed 258-token prompt over
20 warm-condition iterations per device, we measure throughput, latency, power,
and thermal behaviour. For mobile platforms, thermal management supersedes
peak compute as the primary constraint: the iPhone 16 Pro loses nearly half its
throughput within two iterations, and the S24 Ultra suffers a hard OS-enforced
GPU frequency floor that terminates inference entirely. On dedicated hardware,
distinct constraints dominate: the RTX 4050 is bounded by its battery power ceiling,
while the Hailo-10H is limited by on-module memory bandwidth. The RTX 4050
sustains 131.7 tok/s at 34.1 W; the Hailo-10H sustains 6.9 tok/s at under 2 W
with near-zero variance, matching the RTX 4050 in energy proportionality at 19×
lower throughput. Results should be interpreted as platform-level deployment
characterisations for a single model and prompt type, reflecting hardware and
software combined, rather than general claims about hardware capability alone.
1 Introduction
The emergence of sub-2B parameter language models capable of useful instruction following [ 1,2] has
renewed interest in on-device LLM deployment. Running inference locally offers offline capability,
reduced latency, and privacy, properties that are particularly valuable for always-on personal agents
that must respond to continuous streams of user queries without round-tripping to a cloud server.
Modern mobile SoCs include dedicated neural processing units with tens of TOPS of claimed
throughput [ 5,6], and quantisation techniques such as GPTQ [ 3] and AWQ [ 4] compress models
to under 1 GB, making them memory-feasible on phones and single-board computers. Yet the gap
between peak hardware specifications andsustainedreal-world inference performance under thermal
load remains poorly characterised. Existing benchmarks either target single-inference latency[ 8,13],
cloud-hosted throughput [ 7], or report thermal effects only as a side observation rather than a primary
focus [ 9]. The MELTing Point framework [ 9] provides the closest prior work, characterising LLM

inference on mobile devices with attention to energy and thermal behaviour, but does not run extended
back-to-back query sequences sufficient to reveal the full thermal degradation curve. Xiao et al. [ 10]
benchmark LLMs on mobile platforms with attention to throughput and observe 10–20% degradation
over five consecutive runs, but do not characterise steady-state thermal floors or test beyond a handful
of iterations. MLPerf Inference [ 7] now includes edge LLM scenarios as of v5.1, but measures peak
performance without tracking thermal throttling or sustained-workload behaviour.
On the hardware side, quantised LLM inference on dedicated edge NPUs remains largely unexplored
in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, no independent benchmark of LLM inference on
Hailo hardware has been published; available figures derive from vendor publications alone.
This leaves three questions unanswered: how mobile inference performance degrades over repeated
consecutive queries; whether low-power NPU accelerators can match mobile devices in sustained
throughput per watt; and what the practical trade-offs are between a dedicated GPU, a mobile SoC,
and an edge NPU for always-on agent deployments.
To answer these, we conduct controlled warm-condition benchmarking of Qwen 2.5 1.5B across four
platforms, a Raspberry Pi 5 with Hailo-10H NPU, a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, an iPhone 16 Pro, and
a laptop with NVIDIA RTX 4050 GPU, using a standardised prompt and uniform metric collection
across 20 iterations per device. Our principal contributions are: an independent cross-platform
benchmark of sustained LLM inference including a dedicated edge NPU; empirical characterisation
of thermal degradation curves on two flagship smartphones showing qualitatively different failure
modes; and evidence that the Hailo-10H NPU achieves thermally stable, near-zero-variance inference
at energy proportionality comparable to a laptop GPU, positioning dedicated edge NPUs as a
compelling platform for always-on, power-sensitive deployments. However, the Hailo-10H’s current
throughput of 6.9 tok/s, constrained single-sequence autoregressive decode characteristics, represents
a significant latency limitation for interactive applications, and should be interpreted as a platform
deployment ceiling rather than a fundamental bound on NPU-class inference.
2 Background
2.1 Quantised Inference on Edge Hardware
Post-training quantisation reduces weight precision from BF16/FP16 to INT4, yielding approximately
4×model size reduction with minimal perplexity degradation on instruction-tuned models [ 3,4].
Q4_0 (4-bit grouped quantisation) has become the dominant format for on-device deployment due to
its compatibility with GGUF, MLC-LLM, and MLX runtimes, while GPTQ [ 3] provides an alternative
calibrated quantisation path used by vLLM and PyTorch-based serving stacks. llama.cpp [ 12] provides
cross-platform GGUF-format inference across targets.
2.2 Autoregressive Decoding Phases
LLM inference comprises two phases with distinct compute characteristics. Duringprefill, the input
prompt is processed in parallel; this phase is compute-bound, proportional to prompt length, and dom-
inates time-to-first-token (TTFT). Duringdecode, tokens are generated one at a time autoregressively;
this phase is memory-bandwidth-bound, with throughput determined by KV-cache access speed.
Peak hardware TOPS ratings reflect throughput under compute-bound, high-utilisation conditions.
Prefill is relatively compute-bound and scales with available TOPS; sustained decode throughput is
memory-bandwidth-bound, with throughput determined by KV-cache access speed, a key distinction
when evaluating always-on agents that generate long responses.
2.3 Thermal Throttling in Mobile SoCs
Mobile SoCs rely on passive cooling and must respect strict power budgets to avoid skin temperature
violations. When junction temperatures exceed thermal thresholds, Dynamic V oltage and Frequency
Scaling (DVFS) reduces clock frequencies, directly reducing throughput. Sustained LLM inference is
particularly susceptible to this mechanism. Recent work on mobile DVFS governors [ 14] has shown
that Energy-Aware Scheduling can cause CPUs to run at suboptimally low frequencies during LLM
inference, degrading latency and energy efficiency, illustrating that OS-level power management
interacts with inference workloads in ways beyond simple thermal capping.

3 Methodology
3.1 Platforms and Inference Stacks
We select four platforms spanning the performance–efficiency spectrum relevant to personal agent
deployment: a Raspberry Pi 5 paired with a Hailo-10H M.2 NPU module, representing always-on low-
power edge deployment; a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra as a flagship Android device with Snapdragon
8 Gen 3; an iPhone 16 Pro as a flagship iOS device with Apple A18 Pro; and a laptop with NVIDIA
RTX 4050 GPU as a battery-powered edge device in a laptop form factor. Full hardware and software
specifications are given in Tables 1 and 2.
The Hailo-10H connects via PCIe Gen 3.0, providing 40 TOPS at under 5 W. hailo-ollama partitions
model layers between NPU and CPU, with attention layers offloaded to the NPU and Q4 weights
utilising the NPU’s INT8 compute units via the Hailo Dataflow Compiler. Power is estimated from
the RPi 5 PMIC’s VDD_CORE_A current and VDD_CORE andEXT5V_V voltage rails sampled via the
INA219 sensor at 1 kHz. This measurement reflects total system draw rather than isolated NPU power;
while EXT5V_V is the primary supply rail for the Hailo-10H over PCIe, the absence of a dedicated
current sensor on that pin means the reported figures are indicative of NPU power consumption but
cannot be attributed to the accelerator in isolation.
The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra runs Qwen 2.5 1.5B compiled to TVM binary format targeting the
Adreno 750 GPU via Apache TVM 0.14 through MLC-LLM. The benchmark runs as a custom
headless Android service ( BenchmarkService ) on Android 16, with per-iteration metrics logged
via a terminal-style LogActivity interface. Power measurement via the Android Battery Manager
API was found unreliable under active GPU load and is not reported (see Section 5).
The iPhone 16 Pro runs a custom SwiftUI benchmarking application ( MLXBenchmark ) integrating
MLX Swift (v0.29.1) with inference dispatched to the A18 Pro GPU via Metal compute kernels; the
Neural Engine is not utilised by MLX. Thermal state is monitored via ProcessInfo.thermalState
and battery level via UIDevice.current.batteryLevel at each iteration boundary. iOS does not
expose per-component power draw to third-party applications, so battery state-of-charge is used as
the sole energy proxy.
The RTX 4050 laptop serves the model via vLLM on Ubuntu with PyTorch backend and CUDA
12.1. GPU power, utilisation, and temperature are logged via nvidia-smi at 100 ms intervals. All
runs were conducted on battery under OS power management, which imposes a soft sustained power
ceiling near 35 W, approximately 45% of the GPU’s rated 75 W TGP. Reported throughput therefore
represents battery-throttled performance.

3.2 Model
We select Qwen 2.5 1.5B [ 1] with 4-bit quantisation as the benchmark model. Selection criteria were
threefold: native support across all four inference frameworks, a sub-1 GB memory footprint fitting
all device constraints, and a uniform quantisation level across platforms to minimise compression as a
confounding variable. Each platform uses a native format conversion of the same base weights: GGUF
(hailo-ollama), TVM binary (MLC-LLM), MLX safetensors (iPhone 16 Pro), and HuggingFace
safetensors (vLLM). Weight equivalence is verified via SHA-256 checksums on quantised tensors.
Key specifications are listed in Table 3.

3.3 Prompt and Generation Configuration
All platforms receive an identical prompt (UTF-8, 258 tokens as tokenised by the Qwen 2.5 BPE
tokenizer) that elicits long-form structured output, imposing sustained decode load to stress thermal
management and memory-bandwidth utilisation rather than burst performance. Effective prefill
length including framework-applied chat templates is approximately 270–280 tokens and may vary
marginally across inference stacks.

3. Cognitive science and psychology perspectives, including perception,
attention, self-awareness, and consciousness disorders.
4. Artificial intelligence and machine consciousness, discussing whether

and current limitations of AI systems.
5. Ethical and societal implications of understanding or engineering
consciousness.
Throughout the essay: use clear section headings; explain all technical
terms in plain language; provide illustrative examples where helpful;
compare and contrast different viewpoints; avoid bullet lists unless
necessary for clarity. Conclude with a reflective summary discussing what
remains unknown and what future research directions may look like. The
response should be detailed, continuous, and written in a neutral,
academic tone.
Token generation is capped at 1,000 tokens on iOS; all other platforms are uncapped (EOS-
terminated).
3.4 Metrics
Table 4 defines all metrics collected during benchmarking. Not all metrics are available on all
platforms: thermal state is iOS-only, GPU frequency is Android-only, and power and energy-per-
token are reported only for the RTX 4050 and Hailo-10H due to measurement limitations on mobile
platforms discussed in Section 5.

3.5 Experimental Protocol
We focus on warm-condition inference: the model is loaded once and remains in memory across
all iterations, representing realistic interactive assistant usage where queries arrive consecutively.
Cold-start model loading time is recorded where observable but excluded from throughput and latency
analysis.
Before each benchmark session, the device is allowed to equilibrate for 10 minutes at ambient
temperature (22°C ±2°C). After loading the model and discarding one warm-up inference, we
verify thermal stability ( ∆T <2 °C over 60 seconds) before executing 20 iterations with a 1-second
inter-iteration gap. Per-iteration results are exported to CSV and validated for token count anomalies.

The RTX 4050 sustains a mean throughput of 131.7 tok/s ( σ= 2.87 , CV = 2.2%) with deterministic
output length (1789 tokens per run). Run 1 is excluded as it reflects cold-start model loading
(93.8 tok/s, 52.8 W average power). Under battery power, average power stabilises at 34.1±0.2 W
with transient peaks reaching 35.73 W, confirming the workload is memory-bandwidth bound rather
than compute bound. GPU temperature rises from 55°C at run 2 to 70°C by run 20, reflecting gradual
heat buildup, though no thermal throttling is observed—the throughput CV of 2.2% confirms stable
performance throughout. Energy per token stabilises at297±7mJ across warm runs.

Figure 3: RPi 5 + Hailo-10H throughput (line, left axis) and NPU/CPU temperature (lines, right axis)
across runs 2–20. Throughput CV of 0.04% and stable temperatures confirm no throttling at any
point.
The Hailo-10H delivers the most consistent inference of any platform in this study. With greedy
decoding, output length is fully deterministic, all 19 warm runs produce exactly 564 tokens, yielding
a decode time CV of 0.04% and a throughput CV of 0.04%, effectively zero variance. Prefill is
similarly invariant at 1,287±1 ms (CV = 0.11%), reflecting the deterministic dispatch behaviour
of the NPU hardware. Average system power (RPi 5 + Hailo-10H combined) is 1.87±0.02 W,
with energy per token of 271±2 mJ, the lowest of any platform in this study. Thermal behaviour
is exemplary: CPU temperature is confined to 52.7±0.8 °C and NPU temperature to 58.5±1.1 °C,
with no upward trend and no throttling observed at any point across all 20 iterations.
The observed throughput of 6.914 tok/s is substantially below the Hailo-10H’s rated 40 TOPS peak
compute figure, which is expected given the nature of autoregressive LLM decode. Vendor TOPS
ratings reflect peak throughput under idealised batch workloads; sustained single-sequence decode is
memory-bandwidth bound rather than compute bound, and cannot exploit the NPU’s parallel compute
units efficiently. The result is broadly consistent with Hailo’s own published figure of 6.82 tok/s for
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct on the same hardware configuration, suggesting the deployment is operating
near the practical ceiling for this platform. The primary bottleneck is on-module LPDDR4 memory
bandwidth rather than PCIe: although the Hailo-10H exposes a PCIe Gen 3 ×4 interface ( 4 GB/s
theoretical), the Raspberry Pi 5 provides only a PCIe Gen 2 ×1 link ( 500 MB/s theoretical, 400
MB/s effective), this constraint does not appear to be the binding limiter given that our measured
throughput matches Hailo’s reference figure obtained under identical link conditions. Additional
deployment-specific constraints include CPU–NPU layer partitioning in hailo-ollama, where attention
layers not offloaded to the NPU execute on the ARM Cortex-A76, and per-token HailoRT dispatch
overhead over PCIe. The 6.914 tok/s result should therefore be interpreted as a memory-bandwidth-
bound deployment figure reflecting the practical ceiling of this platform, rather than a reflection of
the NPU’s peak compute capability.

state: light (Normal, iter 1–2), hatched (Warm, iter 3–7), dark (Hot, iter 8–20). Dashed line marks the
sustained Hot-state mean of 22.56 tok/s.
The iPhone 16 Pro exhibits a clear three-phase thermal trajectory over 20 iterations. During the first
two iterations (Normal state), mean throughput is 37.58 tok/s, peaking at 40.35 tok/s. By iteration 3
the device transitions to a Warm state ( 25.31 tok/s,−37.3% from peak), and from iteration 8 onwards
enters a sustained Hot state ( 22.56±1.14 tok/s,−44.1% from peak) that persists for the remaining
13 iterations, 65% of the benchmark. The overall throughput CV of 20.8% is driven almost entirely
by this thermal state transition rather than run-to-run noise; within the Hot state alone, CV drops
to 5.0%, comparable to the other platforms. The 1-second inter-iteration cooldown is insufficient
to permit any thermal recovery. Battery state of charge drops 10% over 20 iterations, projecting to
approximately 200 inferences per full charge.
The observed thermal degradation is consistent with prior work on iOS LLM inference. Independent
benchmarking of Apple devices under sustained inference [ 10] finds that Apple GPU performance un-
der iOS exhibits noticeable fluctuations throughout the inference process, with degradation occurring
earlier and becoming more pronounced under long-prompt workloads, consistent with our 258-token
prompt driving transition to the Hot thermal state by iteration 8. A separate study on iPhone LLM
inference [ 16] explicitly places devices in an ice-cooled environment to mitigate thermal throttling,
noting that real-world deployment conditions induce heat buildup and frequency scaling not captured
under controlled thermal conditions, corroborating our finding that the 1-second inter-iteration gap is
insufficient for thermal recovery under natural operating conditions.
4.4 Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Android / MLC-LLM)
The Android benchmark yielded only 6 iterations before the OS intervened. From iteration 6 onwards,
the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3’s GPU frequency was floored by the Android thermal governor to 231 MHz,
down from 629–680 MHz in prior iterations, rendering further inference non-representative. Only

line) are used for analysis. Iteration 6 (open marker, dashed) is excluded: the Android thermal
governor floored GPU frequency to 231 MHz, with GPU temperature reaching 78.3°C.
Across the five valid iterations, the S24 Ultra sustains a mean throughput of 9.93±0.79 tok/s (CV =
8.0%) with a consistent prefill time of 25,128±512 ms (CV = 2.0%), reflecting stable Adreno 750
GPU scheduling prior to throttling. The anomalously high prefill-time relative to other platforms is
likely attributable to MLC-LLM’s OpenCL compilation and dispatch overhead on the Adreno 750
rather than raw hardware latency. Iteration 6 documents a hard OS-enforced thermal failure: GPU
temperature reached 78.3°C and CPU temperature 73.8°C, the highest thermal readings recorded
across all platforms in this study, and no further iterations completed. This abrupt frequency floor, in
contrast to the iPhone 16 Pro’s gradual DVFS-based degradation, represents a qualitatively different
and more disruptive failure mode for sustained inference.
The observed figures are broadly consistent with prior work on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 inference.
Transformer-Lite [ 15] reports decode throughput of 10–20 tok/s on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for
Qwen 1.5 4B under MLC-LLM, suggesting our 9.93 tok/s result for the smaller 1.5B model is
plausible and likely constrained by MLC-LLM’s OpenCL backend efficiency rather than raw hard-
ware capability. Prior work on mobile LLM benchmarking [ 10] specifically notes that MLC-LLM
on Adreno GPUs performs worse in prefill speed than llama.cpp on CPU, attributed to the difficulty
of optimising LLM operators across heterogeneous mobile GPU architectures, consistent with our
anomalously high prefill-time of 25,128 ms, which we attribute to MLC-LLM OpenCL kernel com-
pilation and dispatch overhead rather than hardware prefill latency. The early thermal termination
at iteration 6 is also consistent with known Snapdragon thermal behaviour: independent mobile
10

## Page 11

benchmarking studies [ 10] limit inference to five consecutive runs per session with mandatory reboots
between rounds to avoid overheating, corroborating our observation that sustained back-to-back
inference without thermal recovery is not viable on this platform.

The RTX 4050 leads by a substantial margin at 131.7 tok/s, delivering 19.0× the throughput of the
Hailo-10H, 5.8× that of the iPhone 16 Pro in its sustained throttled state, and 13.3× that of the S24
Ultra. Among mobile platforms, the iPhone 16 Pro outperforms the S24 Ultra by 2.3× in sustained
throughput, though direct comparison is complicated by differing inference frameworks and the S24
Ultra’s premature benchmark termination.
The Hailo-10H achieves a throughput CV of 0.04%, two orders of magnitude lower than any other
platform, a consequence of deterministic NPU scheduling and fixed-length greedy decoding. Among
platforms with reliable power measurements, the Hailo-10H and RTX 4050 exhibit near-identical
energy proportionality: 0.271 and 0.259 W per tok/s respectively. Despite an 18.2× difference
in absolute power draw and a 19× difference in throughput, the two platforms deliver equivalent
computation per joule, with energy per token of 270.5 mJ (Hailo-10H) versus 297.3 mJ (RTX 4050).
5 Discussion
5.1 Thermal Management as the Binding Constraint
Our results provide strong empirical support for the claim that thermal management, not peak compute,
is the binding constraint for sustained mobile LLM inference. The iPhone 16 Pro demonstrates
excellent peak throughput (40.35 tok/s) but cannot sustain it: degradation occurs within two inferences
and the device remains in a throttled state for 65% of the benchmark, settling at 22.56 tok/s, a 44%
reduction. This is consistent with the passive-cooling design of smartphones, where junction-to-
ambient thermal resistance is high and heat dissipation is constrained by form factor.
The S24 Ultra exhibits a qualitatively different and more severe failure mode. Rather than gradual
DVFS-based throughput reduction, the Android thermal governor enforces a hard GPU frequency
floor at iteration 6, causing GPU temperature to reach 78.3°C and terminating the benchmark entirely.
For agent deployments, this is more disruptive than graceful degradation: the system becomes
unusable for inference rather than merely slower. The 1-second inter-iteration gap does not permit
thermal recovery on either mobile platform, suggesting that always-on agents requiring queries
more frequent than several minutes apart would face sustained degradation or risk throttle-induced
termination.

5.2 The Case for Dedicated Edge NPUs
The Hailo-10H demonstrates that purpose-built NPU inference is thermally stable at a fraction of
mobile platform power draw. At 6.914 tok/s and 1.87 W, it delivers energy proportionality comparable
to the RTX 4050 despite operating at 19× lower throughput. The platform exhibits near-zero
performance variance, deterministic prefill time, and a power envelope compatible with battery or low-
wattage PSU operation. For proactive agent scenarios, where responses are generated asynchronously
and consistent availability is more critical than low latency, this trade-off is compelling. The cold-start
model loading cost (11.86 s) is a one-time overhead that does not affect steady-state operation.
The principal limitation of the current deployment is throughput: at 6.914 tok/s, response generation
for a 500-token reply requires approximately 72 seconds, acceptable for background summarisation
or scheduled digest generation, but prohibitive for interactive turn-by-turn dialogue. This constraint is,
however, substantially attributable to the deployment configuration rather than the NPU itself. Further
gains are plausible through batched or speculative decoding strategies adapted for NPU dispatch.
The 6.914 tok/s figure should therefore be read as a conservative lower bound on Hailo-class NPU
inference rather than a ceiling, and the thermal and efficiency properties demonstrated here are likely
to persist as throughput improves with better host integration.
5.3 Deployment Implications
Table 10 maps our empirical findings to deployment scenarios under the tested framework and hard-
ware configurations. Our data suggest a practical threshold under these conditions: mobile devices
appear to support intermittent queries at approximately 5–10 per hour before thermal constraints
dominate; beyond this rate, dedicated edge NPU hardware or tethered GPU systems are required.
The RTX 4050 delivers strong throughput and thermal stability across all scenarios where AC power
is available, but its 34 W sustained draw imposes meaningful battery constraints. At the observed
drain rate of 12% over 20 inference runs, continuous battery-powered operation would deplete a
typical laptop battery in approximately 2–3 hours under sustained agent workloads, and genuine
always-on battery deployment is not viable at this power envelope. It is therefore rated marginal ( ∼)
for battery-powered always-on use, despite its performance headroom.
The iPhone 16 Pro is suitable for intermittent queries but marginal for interactive use due to the 44%
throughput reduction observed once the device enters the Hot thermal state, which occurs within
two iterations under sustained load. The S24 Ultra is rated marginal across all scenarios due to the
OS-enforced GPU frequency floor that terminated inference at iteration 6; its suitability cannot be
reliably assessed beyond five consecutive queries.
Among the platforms tested, the Hailo-10H is the only one that satisfies all three requirements of
an always-on agent under its tested configuration: thermal stability, low power draw, and consistent
availability across sustained workloads. At under 2 W, it can sustain continuous operation on a
small battery pack or low-wattage PSU indefinitely. The trade-off is throughput: at 6.914 tok/s, the
Hailo-10H delivers 19× lower throughput than the battery-throttled RTX 4050 and 3.3× lower than
the iPhone 16 Pro in its sustained Hot state, making it unsuitable for low-latency streaming responses
but well-suited to asynchronous or background inference workloads.

5.4 Limitations and Threats to Validity
Several aspects of the experimental design limit the generalisability of these findings. The quantisation
formats differ across platforms: Q4_0, q4f16_2, and GPTQ Int4, as each framework exposes different
compression schemes. While all formats are nominally 4-bit, differences in grouping and calibration
may introduce confounding variation in output quality and throughput. More broadly, each platform
uses a different inference framework (vLLM, MLC-LLM, MLX, hailo-ollama), meaning that observed
performance differences reflect the combined effect of hardwareandsoftware rather than hardware
alone. The S24 Ultra’s anomalously high prefill-time, for example, may be largely framework-driven.
The study evaluates a single model (Qwen 2.5 1.5B) with a single long-form generation prompt.
Shorter outputs, smaller models, or conversational prompts may exhibit different thermal trajectories.
Token generation lengths also differ across platforms (564–1789 tokens), which affects thermal load
duration and complicates direct comparison of thermal behaviour.
The Android data is severely limited: only 5 valid iterations were collected before an OS-enforced
GPU frequency floor terminated the benchmark, and power figures are excluded due to Battery
Manager API measurement unreliability. iOS does not expose per-component power draw, precluding
energy-per-token comparison. The RTX 4050 was benchmarked on battery, and results represent
battery-throttled performance rather than the GPU’s full capability. Finally, only one unit per platform
was tested; device-to-device variability in thermal performance is not characterised.
Power measurement methodology is inconsistent across platforms, which limits cross-platform energy
comparisons. The RTX 4050 uses nvidia-smi GPU power reporting at 100 ms intervals, capturing
GPU-level draw with reasonable accuracy. The RPi 5 + Hailo-10H uses an INA219 current sensor
on the PMIC supply rails, reflecting total system draw rather than isolated accelerator power. The
S24 Ultra relies on the Android Battery Manager API, which was found unreliable under active GPU
load and is excluded from analysis entirely. The iPhone 16 Pro exposes no per-component power
API, so battery state-of-charge is used as a coarse energy proxy. As a result, the energy-per-token
figures reported for the RTX 4050 and Hailo-10H are not directly comparable: the RTX figure reflects
GPU-level power while the Hailo figure reflects whole-system power including the RPi 5 SoC. True
accelerator-level energy efficiency on the Hailo-10H is likely lower than reported. Standardised
power instrumentation across platforms remains an open challenge for edge LLM benchmarking and
is a priority for future work.
5.5 Conclusion and Future Work
Thermal throttling is the primary constraint for mobile LLM inference. The iPhone 16 Pro loses 44%
of its throughput within two inferences and sustains that degradation for 65% of all test iterations.
The S24 Ultra suffers a hard OS-enforced GPU frequency floor that terminates inference entirely after
6 iterations. These findings suggest that, under the conditions tested, current smartphones may be
poorly suited for always-on agent workloads and appear better matched to intermittent query patterns
at low rates. The thermal behaviour observed here, specifically the rapid throughput degradation on
the iPhone 16 Pro and the hard frequency floor on the S24 Ultra, indicates that sustained back-to-back
inference without adequate cooldown intervals is likely to degrade reliability on passively cooled
mobile hardware, though the extent of this effect may vary across devices, operating conditions, and
inference frameworks.
Dedicated edge NPUs offer a viable alternative. The Hailo-10H sustains 6.914 tok/s at 1.87 W with a
throughput CV of 0.04% and no throttling, matching the RTX 4050 in energy proportionality at 19×
lower throughput. A laptop GPU provides the highest raw throughput (131.7 tok/s) but requires a
power source for sustained deployment.
Future work will extend iteration counts to 100+ for long-duration thermal profiling, replace the
Android Battery Manager API with a hardware current sensor for reliable power measurement,
investigate duty-cycling and active cooling strategies for mobile deployment, evaluate the impact of
quantisation format unification across platforms, and assess additional models and prompt types to
broaden generalisability.
