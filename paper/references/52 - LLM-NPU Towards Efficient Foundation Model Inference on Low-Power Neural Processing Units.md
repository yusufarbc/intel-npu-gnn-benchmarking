Abstract —Neural processing units (NPUs) have become essen-
tial in modern client and edge platforms, offering unparalleled
efficiency by delivering high throughput at low power. This is crit-
ical to improve the TOPS/W of the NPU, leading to longer battery
life. While NPUs were initially designed to efficiently execute com-
puter vision (CV) workloads such as CNNs, the rising demand to
run transformer-based large language models (LLMs) locally now
calls for significant architectural and software adaptation. This
paper presents LLM-NPU, a comprehensive software-hardware
co-optimization framework that enables scalable, power-efficient
LLM deployment on NPUs under tight compute and memory
budgets. We present software solutions such as vertical and
horizontal operator fusion, quantization-aware weight compres-
sion, hybrid key-value (KV) quantization, eviction strategies,
and static-shape inference that target memory bottlenecks and
compute inefficiencies in LLM execution. On the hardware
side, we explore domain-specialized NPU enhancements, includ-
ing processing-in-memory architectures, extended input channel
accumulation, structured sparsity acceleration, GEMM engine
optimizations, mixed precision, microscaling format support, and
fusion-aware execution pipelines. These co-designed innovations
can collectively improve the energy, throughput, and latency of
NPUs for LLM workloads.
Keywords—Energy-efficient inference, on-device AI, weight
quantization, KV optimization, operator fusion, processing-in-
memory, structured sparsity.
I. I NTRODUCTION
The quest for efficient and low-power hardware accelerators
has been propelled by the emerging need to run large founda-
tion models, including large language models (LLMs), locally
under extreme power and memory constraints. Towards that
goal, the neural processing unit (NPU) has emerged as a
promising architecture due to its state-of-the-art operations
per watt performance metric [1]. Current commercial NPUs
can support up to 48 TOPS in advanced personal computer
processors that can run AI models (AIPC) [2].
NPUs consume less power than integrated GPUs, making
them a valuable class of accelerators for on-device LLM
inference on AI-enabled PCs. Their energy efficiency allows
battery-powered devices to operate much longer when running
LLM workloads. However, deploying LLMs on NPUs is
challenging due to the significant memory and computational
demands of inference, which are difficult to meet on resource-
constrained edge NPUs.
To mitigate these gaps, we present LLM-NPU, a stream
of software and hardware optimizations for LLMs. Soft-
ware optimizations include tiling and fusion methods for
improving memory reuse and compiler techniques to enable
memory-efficient static shape LLM inference. We also discuss

tization with architecture-aware grouping and dimensioning,
as well as cache eviction strategies to handle long sequence
processing under limited memory constraints.
On the hardware front, we delineate a set of domain-
specialized NPU enhancements tailored for LLM inference.
These include processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures that
minimize off-chip data transfers and improve energy pro-
portionality and extended input channel accumulation paths
designed to support deep transformer stacks with high-rank
tensors. Structured sparsity acceleration using 2:4 block pat-
terns is illustrated to enable efficient zero-skipping and storage
compression. Optimizations to the GEMM engine are also
highlighted, along with further elaboration of architectural
value for mixed-precision compute units, enabling runtime
adaptability to tensor-specific precision needs. Finally, fusion-
aware datapaths are presented, showing tightly integrated
pipelines to execute operations like SoftMax and reshape oper-
ations inline, thus reducing intermediate buffering to improve
end-to-end efficiency.
We present a detailed accuracy and hardware performance
analysis with popular LLMs, including LLaMA3 [3] and
Qwen2.5 [4] on LongBench [5], and LM harness [6] to
demonstrate the combined efficacy of our optimizations. For
example, with joint KV cache optimization, we can yield up
to∼6× compression of the same without costing an accuracy
drop. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Sections
IIandIIIsummarize the related work and NPU architecture
overview, respectively. We present the details of software and
hardware innovations for efficient LLM inference in Section
IVand V, respectively. We present the detailed accuracy
analysis with hardware evaluations in Section VIand finally
conclude in VII.
II. R ELATED WORKS
Low-Power Hardware for Foundation Models. Recent ad-
vancements for on-device LLM acceleration have emphasized
the need for specialized NPU architectures to minimize mem-
ory bottlenecks and energy costs. EdgeLLM [7] proposes
a CPU-FPGA heterogeneous accelerator that employs mix-
precision processing and structured weight sparsity to achieve
high throughput and energy efficiency for LLMs on edge
devices. Similarly, ATOMUS [8] presents a latency-optimized
System-on-Chip (SoC) with hierarchical neural engines and
task-aware scheduling, achieving significant speedups on large
transformer models like T5-3B. While NITRO [9] enables
dynamic autoregressive token generation for LLMs on Intel
NPUs, it primarily focuses on software-level orchestration
without addressing deeper architectural co-design or fusion-

efficient LLM inference system leveraging on-device NPUs
to significantly reduce prefill latency and energy consumption
through prompt and model reconstruction at multiple levels.
These directions collectively highlight the architectural shift
toward tightly integrated, dataflow-optimized NPUs tailored
for transformer models.
Model and Compiler Optimizations. To deploy large models
efficiently on resource-limited hardware, researchers have pre-
sented various model optimizations, including model weight
pruning [11], [12], token pruning [13], and weight/activation
quantization [14]–[16]. Apart from model optimizations, var-
ious compiler-level optimizations such as operator fusion and
tiling operations [17] have translated to efficient data reuse
and reduced memory operations. Most of these methods were
developed in the context of GPU hardware, and thus, their
optimal usage for NPU is not straightforward. Additionally,
NPU architecture has other limitations requiring novel soft-
ware solutions to run efficient LLM inference.
III. P RELIMINARIES : NPU A RCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
The NPU is a domain-specific accelerator optimized for ex-
ecuting deep learning workloads. Designed to deliver high
inference throughput under strict power constraints, the NPU
architecture comprises of three primary subsystems: control,
compute, and data movement, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The data movement subsystem is orchestrated by a direct
memory access (DMA) engine and on-chip SRAM cache
(hardware or software-managed), which together facilitate
high-bandwidth, low-latency transfers between system DRAM
and on-chip memory (e.g., SRAM). Typically, weights reside
in off-chip DRAM, while activations and intermediate tensors
are buffered in SRAM to maximize locality and reduce access
overhead. The compute subsystem consists of a scalable array
of AI Compute Engines. Each engine integrates a fixed-
function neural network processor (NNP) [18] with a dense
MAC array for matrix multiplications and convolutions, a post-
processing module (PPM) for scaling, activation, and quanti-
zation, as well as dedicated Load and Drain units for memory
staging and result formatting. In addition, programmable Vec-
tor DSPs within each engine handle fine-grained elementwise
operations, including non-linear functions (e.g., GeLU, Swish)
and transformer-specific layers such as SoftMax, LayerNorm,
and other vector operations. These tightly integrated modules
enable fused execution and minimize intermediate data move-
ment. The control subsystem handles runtime task scheduling,
synchronization, and power management. It coordinates ex-
ecution across multiple compute engines, monitors memory
flow, and ensures efficient workload distribution to maintain
high utilization and low latency across diverse ML workloads.
IV. LLM-NPU S OFTWARE OPTIMIZATIONS
We focus on cross-layer techniques that address memory
bottlenecks, reduce redundant computation across tokens, and
enhance hardware utilization through dynamic shape handling

and control-flow aware execution, spanning both prefill and
decode stages.
A. Fusion and Tiling Strategies
LLM inference presents unique challenges due to complex
operator sequences- particularly non-linear transformations
including SoftMax and LayerNorm, and memory-intensive
components like attention, where storage and bandwidth de-
mands scale quadratically with sequence length. Tiling and
operator fusion are well-established graph or kernel-based
optimizations [20]–[22] that help address these inefficiencies
by restructuring computation graphs to improve data locality,
maximize on-chip memory reuse by reducing memory trans-
fers, and increase compute throughput. Two complementary
classes of fusion strategies are widely adopted across diverse
hardware platforms: NPU [2], [23]–[25], GPU, and CPU to
enable high-performance LLM inference.
Tiling . In LLMs, spatial and temporal tiling strategies are
employed by modern NPU compilers to partition large atten-
tion and feed-forward (FFN) layers along dimensions such
as sequence length, head, and embedding dim. to fit within
limited on-chip memory. These tiling choices, guided by the
layer shape and hardware constraints, often require partial
replication or slicing of Q,K,V, and intermediate activations
across tiles, with the goal of reducing data movement overhead
and maximizing compute utilization.
Vertical Fusion (VF) . Combined with tiling, this strategy
reduces off-chip memory accesses by fusing dependent op-
erations. As illustrated in Figure 2b, Inter-operator VF is
commonly applied to LLM attention computation, where
operations such as matrix multiplications ( QKT), masking,
SoftMax, and Vprojection are fused to align with on-chip
memory constraints. FlashAttention [20] achieves this by
partitioning Q,K, andVinto SRAM-friendly tiles, preventing
materialization of the full N×Nattention matrix and en-
abling pipelined execution of data movement, higher through-
put GEMM (mapped to MAC array) with lower throughput
SoftMax (mapped to DSP), as shown in FlashAttention-3
and variants [19], [21], [26]. Intra-operator VF (Figure 2c)
builds on similar principles by pipelining sequences such
as dequantization, GEMM, activation, and re-quantization to
maximize register reuse and reduce on-chip memory traffic.

Horizontal Fusion (HF) . Horizontal fusion merges operations
across independent branches with shared input activations or
weights, such as Q/K/V projections in attention, and gate
and up-projection in FFN block, into single macro-operations
(Figure 2d). This increases arithmetic intensity, reduces kernel
overhead, and better utilizes accelerator resources.
B. Weight Compression
LLMs often contain billions of parameters, making the full
precision (FP32/FP16/BF16) models challenging to deploy
efficiently on modern NPUs, due to high memory footprint
and compute costs. Weight quantization significantly reduces
model size by converting high-precision weights to lower-
precision formats (e.g., INT8, INT4, INT2). To reduce on-
device memory footprint, memory access latency, and pre-
fill/decoding latency in LLMs, post-training techniques—such
as per-channel and per-group symmetric/asymmetric quanti-
zation—are commonly employed using calibration with rep-
resentative inputs. Recent works [14] adopt multi-objective
layer-wise optimization to minimize quantization error while
maintaining model accuracy. Compiler backends then lower
the quantized models to NPU-executable form, inserting quan-
tize/dequantize operations and selecting optimized mixed/low-
precision kernels [19]. Fusion of quantized operator sequences
further reduces memory traffic and improves execution effi-
ciency. Hardware-aware implementations may also organize
quantized weights channel-wise to exploit architectural fea-
tures (described in Section V-G), enabling high-throughput,
low-latency LLM inference.
Moreover, N:M sparsity for weights has remained a practical
optimization [12]. We thus present a joint post-training weight
compression method combining the benefits of both worlds,
leveraging the 2:4 (or 4:8) sparsity with low-precision weights.
In Section V we further discuss the corresponding hardware
support for the N:M sparsity.
C. KV caching and KV compression
KV Caching. Repetitive recomputation of the KV during the
decode phase can significantly affect the throughput. Thus,
instead of recomputation, KV caching has become a stan-
dard method for throughput-efficient LLM inference. We thus
follow this caching method for the previously computed and
prefill KV . However, for the quadratic autoregressive models
[27], [28], the KV cache grows linearly with the sequence
length, further intensifying the memory bottleneck of the
decode stage. To limit the memory and bandwidth demand
of the KV cache, we present two classes of solutions, namely,
the KV cache quantization andeviction .
KV Cache Quantization. Based on the outlier distribution of
the KV tensor, we present per-channel grouping for the K and
per-token grouping of the V tensor in the cache. Due to the
hybrid nature of the grouping dimension across K and V , its
called hybrid group quantization [15]. The elements within a
group follow uniform quantization with a shared FP16 scaling
and zero point. To maintain high generation quality at low KV
precision, we keep the most recent tokens in FP16. This helps
us maintain high performance at low precision and reduces
the frequent quantization overhead unless the number of FP16
recent tokens reaches a pre-defined block size of N. Apart
from hybrid grouping, we also observe good accuracy merit
with Per-token grouping , for each token or sequence group,
we take gchannels and create a group with a size of 1×g.Empirically, we observe that the hybrid group of KV and the
per-token grouping of KV yield significantly better accuracy
than the per-channel grouping for both tensors.
KV Eviction. Only quantization may not be sufficient to
address the growing KV issue, specifically for sequence length
≥4K. Various training-free methods like [29] [30] [13] have
been proposed to handle this. However, many often fail to
yield good accuracy at high eviction for complex retrieval
or reasoning tasks [15]. Thus, inspired by the recent success
of [13], we adopt a KV eviction strategy based on a chunk
of the most recent prefill tokens, namely the observation
window (OW). In principle, it relies on the fact that each
attention head/layer targets specific prompt attention features
during generation, which can be identified from an observation
window at the end of the prompts.
D. LLM Static Shape Inference
LLMs generally generate variable-length sequences with dy-
namic input/output shapes. In contrast, modern NPU accelera-
tors favor static-shaped tensors for efficient memory allocation,
just-in-time (JIT) optimizations (e.g., torch.compile ), and
reduced runtime overhead. This mismatch limits LLM in-
ference performance on edge and client devices. To address
this, the NPU compiler leverages graph- andruntime-level
lossless optimizations that convert dynamic LLMs into static-
shape equivalents and runs static-shape inference pipeline
(Algorithm 1). First, input IDs, attention mask, and position
IDs of the prefill model are right-padded to prompt length
(SLP). This allows the prefill model to accept prompts up to
a maximum of SLPand generates a static KV cache of length
SLP[31]. Masking ensures computation is confined to valid
tokens in both prefill and decode phases. In the decode model,
mask and KV cache are right-padded to response length ( SLR)
to support token generation up to the same length.
During the prefill phase, statically allocated self- and/or
cross-attention KV caches are initialized. In the decode phase,
only the KV vectors for the most recent token, indexed by
position ID ( posdecode ), are computed, avoiding full-buffer
recomputation as is standard in transformer KV caching. The
NPU compiler optimization, KV zero-copy update , improves
this process by eliminating the need to write entire KV
cache of size SLRin SRAM/DRAM. Instead, it enables the
CPU to insert the newly computed K/V vectors directly into
their target locations (using posdecode ) into shared memory
buffers in DRAM using zero-copy interfaces. Layout-aware
storage formats for KV cache further eliminate costly trans-
poses during attention computation. This fully static approach
with memory-efficient KV cache eliminates dynamic memory
ops and reduces memory write traffic, latency, and energy
consumption, enabling highly efficient, accelerator-friendly
execution with minimal overhead and preserved accuracy.
E. Speculative Decoding on Static-Shape NPUs
Apart from these software optimizations, we support model
operation-level optimizations, including speculative decoding.
Specifically, speculative decoding [32] converts sequential
generation to parallel generation with the help of a draft-
verifier generation strategy. Here, the draft model is generally
a lightweight, small model generating tokens sequentially
[33], while the large verifier model verifies the generated
tokens in parallel, improving the per-token generation latency.
In our design, the draft model generally runs on the NPU

asynchronously on CPU or GPU, thereby leveraging multiple
compute IPs on the platform [2]. This hybrid approach com-
bines NPU-accelerated speculative generation with dynamic
verification, enabling efficient, scalable LLM inference at the
edge with tight compute and memory budgets.
V. LLM-NPU H ARDWARE FEATURES
We focus on the transition toward domain-specialized designs
that prioritize throughput, minimize latency, and enhance
energy efficiency across inference and training workloads.
A. Systolic to Compute-in/near-memory Transition
Systolic arrays have long been a staple in deep learning
accelerators, leveraging spatial reuse and synchronized MAC
pipelines to deliver high arithmetic intensity. However, as
LLMs grow in scale and complexity, they introduce chal-
lenges, such as sparse attention, variable-length sequences, and
irregular memory accesses, that limit systolic utilization and
exacerbate data movement overheads. The physical decoupling
of compute and memory in such architectures often leads to
increased latency and energy consumption, especially when
frequent transfers of weights and activations are required. This
traditional separation is illustrated in Figure 3a, and further
emphasized in Figure 3b.
To address these limitations, a range of memory-centric
compute paradigms has gained traction, including processing-
in-memory (PiM) [34], compute-near-cache (CnC) [35], and
compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures spanning both digital
[36] and analog [37] implementations. As depicted in Fig-
ure 3c, These approaches aim to co-locate logical compute
elements closer to memories at different hierarchies—thereby
reducing off-array data movement. By operating near or within
the memory fabric, these designs exploit high-bandwidth local
access to data, which is particularly beneficial for LLMs
dominated by matrix-vector and matrix-matrix operations.
Such architectures enable flexible dataflow strategies, sup-
porting both weight- and activation-stationary modes. While
activation-stationary flows are useful in convolutional settings,
many transformer workloads benefit from weight-stationary
mappings that keep model weights persistent in memory while
streaming in activations, amortizing load costs across tokens
and layers. Digital near/in-memory compute designs [21],
[36], [38] have demonstrated up to 3 ×–5×energy efficiency
and 2×latency improvements in LLM inference compared
to conventional NPUs. As models grow, integrating compute
closer to memory offers a scalable path forward for energy-
efficient, high-throughput AI acceleration.
Fig. 3: Systolic array vs PiM design architectural comparison.
B. Extended Input Channel (IC) Accumulation
The decode phase of LLM inference, especially during autore-
gressive generation, is heavily memory-bound due to the large
dimensionality of context embeddings and growing activation
map sizes. This bottleneck intensifies in later transformer
layers, where multi-head attention and MLP blocks operate
over high-rank tensors with hundreds or thousands of ICs.
Traditional MAC arrays, optimized for low-latency tile-based
GEMMs, struggle with long IC accumulation due to shallow
on-chip buffers, resulting in frequent partial sum offloads to
DRAM or shared scratchpads. These off-chip transfers intro-
duce latency, energy overheads, and pipeline stalls, limiting
compute bandwidth utilization.
PiM architectures address this by supporting extended IC
accumulation depth via local register folding or periphery-
latched partial sums, enabling sustained accumulation over
large channel windows before flushing results. This approach
improves arithmetic intensity, reduces DRAM traffic, and
enhances temporal data locality, which is key for transformer
feed-forward and attention layers operating on wide embed-
ding vectors. Such designs avoid intermediate evictions and
maintain in-situ computation for long sequences or high head
widths. Studies like [39] report 1.5 ×–2×throughput gains
and 2×energy savings per token with deeper IC accumu-
lation in PiM arrays. These gains scale with model and
sequence size, making IC-depth-optimized PiM essential for
efficient LLM acceleration. Additionally, deeper accumulation
reduces switching activity on buses and interfaces, improving
energy proportionality and aligning with architectural trends
that tightly integrate compute, storage, and accumulation in
localized domains.
C. Sparsity Acceleration and Compression
Transformer-based models, including large-scale LLMs, have
the potential to be induced with significant weight sparsity,
particularly in attention and feedforward layers [40]. Exploit-
ing this sparsity is crucial for improving energy efficiency
and throughput, but unstructured sparsity introduces irregular
memory access patterns and high control complexity. Struc-
tured sparsity formats, applied primarily to weights, such as
the 2:4 fine-grained scheme, where each four-element block
contains exactly two non-zeros, mitigate these issues through
regular, compiler-enforceable patterns. This regularity enables
predictable scheduling, reduces indexing overhead, and sim-
plifies hardware design by avoiding content-addressable mem-
ories and complex gating logic. Zero-skipping pipelines and
mask-aware dispatch units selectively route non-zero operands,

thereby avoiding wasted computation and improving overall
throughput. The format also enables compact compression
schemes, thereby reducing memory bandwidth demands dur-
ing matrix fetches.
Compared to unstructured sparsity, which requires com-
plex gather/scatter logic and wide MUX networks, structured
weight sparsity enables much simpler control logic, as shown
in Figure 3d. For example, sparsity decoding can be imple-
mented using fixed-function units like 4-to-2 selector trees,
significantly lowering area, power, and routing complexity.
Static sparsity maps also allow compile-time scheduling, re-
ducing runtime logic and enabling prefetch alignment and
warp-wide coalescing. As demonstrated in recent research
[12], [41], 2:4 sparsity can deliver up to 2 ×theoretical
throughput gains with minimal accuracy loss when models
are properly pruned and fine-tuned. For LLMs, where spar-
sity is increasingly integrated into training and quantization
pipelines, support for structured weight sparsity is not merely
an optimization but a foundational requirement for scalable,
energy-efficient inference.
D. GEMM Engine Optimization
LLM workloads differ fundamentally from CNNs, shifting
computation from convolution-heavy 7D tensor operations to
dense, batched 3D/4D GEMMs. The core compute pattern
in transformers centers on GEMM operations of the form
[B, M, K ]×[B, K, N ]→[B, M, N ], where Bis batch or
head count, MandNare sequence and embedding sizes,
andKis the shared reduction axis. This shift demands NPUs
optimized for high-throughput, low-latency GEMM, rather
than convolution-specific datapaths with im2col, dilation, or
reuse buffers. Streamlined systolic or register-tiled MAC ar-
rays improve PE utilization and reduce control overhead.
Modern LLM NPUs adopt flexible tiling, quantization-aware
partitioning ( e.g., INT8/FP8), and batched GEMM support,
often fused with load-compute-store pipelines using double-
buffered SRAMs to overlap memory fetch and execution.
Transformers also require support for non-square matrices
and variable K, particularly for attention. PiM-based GEMM
engines are ideal for such workloads, enabling static weight
placement, minimal data movement, and high operand reuse.
Tailored GEMM pipelines with wide MAC lanes and attention-
aware memory layouts have shown 30–40% performance gains
in LLM layers [42]. These gains scale with model width and
batch size, reinforcing the need for GEMM-specialized NPUs.
E. Operator and Dataflow-Level Fusion
Fusion-aware design is critical in NPUs for LLMs, where
operations such as dequantization, GEMM, bias addition,
activation, quantization, reshape, and transpose can be exe-
cuted in a tightly integrated pipeline. Rather than separating
these steps across modules or memory transfers, fusion-aware
datapaths enable operand reuse within the accelerator. As
shown in Figure 2a, modern NPUs consist of four stages:
Fig. 5: FP-PiM and INT-PiM operation on a common PiM
macro (digital/analog) illustrating FP pre-alignment only.
Block size matches with MX group sizes.
Load, MAC Array, PPM, and Drain. The Load unit performs
dequantization of weights and activations and handles struc-
tured sparsity; the MAC Array handles GEMM and convo-
lution operations; the PPM applies bias, scale, linear/partial-
linear activation functions, and quantization; and the Drain
applies sparse compression on the output. DSP units enable
SoftMax, LayerNorm, non-linear (trancendental) activations,
transpose, and other vector operations in LLMs. This modular
pipeline supports all forms of vertical and horizontal fusion
across multiple NPU engines as explained in Section IV-A,
thereby improving energy efficiency and reducing latency,
especially for long sequences and deep transformer stacks. A
key challenge in fused execution is the SoftMax operation
in attention mechanisms, which involves compute-intensive
exponential and division steps and requires high numerical pre-
cision. While activations may be quantized to INT8 or lower,
SoftMax often demands FP16 or higher to maintain accuracy,
necessitating mixed-precision support. In some NPU designs,
parts of SoftMax are fused within the NNP using LUT-based
exponentiation, normalization, and parallel reduction units for
max/sum [21]. This integration allows tight coupling with
GEMM and activation logic, minimizing on-chip memory
accesses. Fusion-aware architectures, as shown in [43], reduce
latency by up to 25%, and dedicated SoftMax hardware units,
such as those in [44], achieve up to 5×speedup over software
implementations.
F . Programmable Activation Functions
A common strategy to efficiently support activation functions
in LLM workloads—such as GeLU, SiLU, and Sigmoid—is
to use a programmable piecewise polynomial unit (PPU)
[45]. As illustrated in Figure 4, this unit employs polyno-
mial approximation techniques to evaluate nonlinear functions
with minimal reliance on DSP-intensive hardware. A config-
urable lookup table (C-LUT) stores precomputed coefficients
an, . . . , a 0along with segment boundaries, enabling runtime
evaluation using expressions of the form f(x)≈anxn+
···+a1x+a0. The typical design includes a state machine,
LUT address generator, and coefficient memory that work
together to identify the appropriate polynomial segment for
a given input. The result is computed through a multiply-
accumulate (MAC) datapath within the PPU, often positioned
directly along the output path of the primary MAC unit. This
integration enables in-place activation computation, reducing
latency and eliminating the need for intermediate buffering.
The C-LUT’s programmability allows the system to support
new or custom activation functions without requiring changes
to the hardware. At the same time, tunable polynomial degree
balances approximation accuracy and resource efficiency.

G. Multi-Precision and MX Format Support in Hardware
To balance power efficiency and numerical accuracy, LLM-
targeted NPUs increasingly support a broad spectrum of
numeric formats, including FP16, FP8, INT8, and config-
urable MX/NV variants such as MXFP8, MXINT8, and
MXFP4. These formats allow dynamic tuning of exponent
and mantissa widths to match precision needs per tensor.
While INT8 and FP8 are often native compute types, ultra-
low-precision formats like INT4, INT2, and FP4—including
NF4, SF4, and MXFP4 [46]–[48]—are primarily used for
memory compression and up-converted to higher-precision
types (e.g., FP8/INT8) at runtime. Group-wise quantization
with group sizes from 8 to 128 elements is standard, with per-
group scale factors encoded in compact forms such as E8M0,
FP16, or BF16. Efficient support for these formats requires
mixed-precision ALUs (e.g., FP16-FP8, FP8-INT4), runtime
format conversion, and flexible quantization units typically
orchestrated in the PPM. Arithmetic is often approximated
using reduced-width adder trees, strength-reduced shifters, or
LUTs, enabling low-cost implementations of multipliers and
quantizers. Accumulation is frequently performed in FP16
instead of FP32 to reduce power and area further.
FP computation within integer-style arrays can be achieved
via exponent-aware reinterpretation, allowing reuse of INT
MAC units for low-precision FP formats. Both pre- and post-
alignment strategies are viable here, each offering tradeoffs:
pre-aligned schemes reduce logic complexity and favor energy
efficiency, while post-aligned variants yield better numerical
accuracy at higher hardware cost, as illustrated in Figure 5.
MXFP8 has demonstrated 2–3 ×inference speedups with
minimal accuracy loss [49], and techniques like GPTQ [50]
further enhance quantization efficacy within the existing PPM
pipeline. Additionally, hardware support for ReduceMean and
ReduceMax enables efficient runtime scale estimation for
dynamic quantization.
VI. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Models and Datasets
We primarily evaluate on two distinct families of LLM ar-
chitectures with varying parameter counts, namely: LLaMA
[51] [3] and Qwen-2.5 [4]. Both models are built on decoder-only transformer architectures that leverage grouped query
attention (GQA) for optimized scalability. However, Qwen-2.5
distinguishes itself through advanced pre-training and refined
post-training techniques, enhancing its overall performance
and adaptability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
the different optimization strategies to assess performance
on standard benchmarks, focusing on natural language un-
derstanding, question answering, and reasoning capabilities.
For this evaluation, we selected the following benchmarks
from LM Harness [6]: MMLU, Winogrande, ARC-c, ARC-e,
PIQA, BoolQ, HellaSwag, and lambada-openai. For MMLU,
we present results based on a 5-shot evaluation, whereas
for the remaining tasks, we provide zero-shot performance.
Furthermore, we demonstrate results on the LongBench [5]
and RULER [52] datasets to assess performance in long-
context scenarios, specifically evaluating the effectiveness of
OW-based eviction and joint KV Cache optimization. Specifi-
cally, we selected six tasks from the LongBench and RULER
datasets to assess performance.
B. Results: Accuracy Analysis
N:M Sparsity . This section examines the impact of different
N:M sparsity variations on model accuracy. Specifically, we
employ 2:4 and 4:8 sparsity configurations in our experiments
and prune all model layers. Following model pruning, we
utilize the Alpaca dataset [53] for LoRA-based recovery
fine-tuning for 20 iterations. Table I presents both zero-shot
accuracy and post-fine-tuning accuracy across various tasks
from the LM Harness. Our findings indicate that increasing
the N:M ratio from 2:4 to 4:8 consistently enhances accuracy
across all datasets. Notably, 4:8 sparsity achieves up to a
5% improvement on average, without additional fine-tuning.
Furthermore, with just few fine-tuning iterations, we can
recover up to 3% accuracy on average.
KV Cache Optimization . Figure 6a presents the evaluation
results with LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct [3] on standard tasks from
the LM Harness, comparing per-token and hybrid group-
wise KV Cache quantization across various tasks. In these
experiments, weights are not quantized and are maintained in
FP16. The results indicate that the hybrid grouping approach
outperforms per-token grouping for both 4-bit and 8-bit quan-
tization. The difference in performance is particularly notable
for 4-bit scenarios, where the hybrid approach outperforms
per-token grouping by 1.2%
Furthermore, Figure 6b illustrates the joint KV cache op-
timization results with LLaMA-2-7B-Chat-4K [51], incorpo-
rating OW-based KV eviction along with KV quantization on
multiple tasks from LongBench. These findings demonstrate
that eviction complements KV quantization, leading to min-
imal accuracy loss across various tasks, even with 4-bit KV .

Fig. 7: Heterogeneous token budget for KV eviction.
TABLE II: KV eviction speedup in LLaMA3.1-8B.
KV Budget 32 256 512 1024 2048 4096
TPOT Speed-up (%) 32.2 29.8 28.6 23.5 12.5 0
Interestingly, in some instances, KV eviction slightly surpasses
the baseline performance, potentially due to the regularizing
effect of token dropping, which may enhance accuracy.
Ablation on Heterogeneous Eviction . We explore two sce-
narios: head-heavy : the first 16 layers of the LLaMA-3-8B-
Instruct are assigned a higher token budget while the last
16 layers are allocated a lower budget; and tail-heavy : this
allocation order is the reverse of head-heavy, with initial
layers being assigned a low KV budget. In Figure 7a and
Figure 7b, we use the RULER [52] dataset, with average token
budgets of 4096 and 3072 respectively, across input sequence
lengths of 8K and 16K. In both scenarios, the head-heavy
budget assignment significantly outperforms the tail-heavy
case, suggesting that the initial layers are less sensitive to KV
eviction than the latter. Additionally, the results in Figure 7
indicate that the head-heavy assignment results in a minimal
drop in accuracy compared to uniform budget assignment,
even with a 25% lower average budget. This highlights the
merit of heterogeneous KV eviction with a focus on more KV
retention at the initial layers.
Weight only Quantization . Figure 6c illustrates the effect
of various weight-only quantization data types on the accu-
racy of LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct [3]. Specifically, we present
the accuracy metrics for MXFP4, MXFP8, INT8, and FP16
data types on selected benchmarks from the LM Harness.
The average accuracy results for MXFP4 and MXFP8 data
types show a slight decrease compared to the FP16 baseline,
even without employing sophisticated calibration methods.
MXFP8 surpasses INT8 by approximately 1.3% on average
across tasks, highlighting a notable advantage of micro-scaling
formats over conventional data types.
C. Results: Hardware Performance Analysis
We now evaluate the effectiveness of various optimizations
of prefill time-to-first-token (TTFT) and decode time-per-
output-token (TPOT), respectively. Additionally, we present
the normalized system energy cost on an AIPC to run an LLM
inference. The experiments were conducted on Intel® Core™
Ultra Series 2 flagship Lunar Lake (LNL) [54] platform
(32GB RAM, 268V). We used OpenVINO’s benchmarking
(llm_bench ) tool for inference and HWINFO [55] to mea-
sure energy consumption. The impact on fusion and N:M
sparsity was estimated using the VPU-EM tool [56].
Fusion . To evaluate the effectiveness of vertical fusion, we
conducted performance tests on Intel Core Ultra 2. The com-
bination of temporal andinter-operator fusion provides 17%,
48%, and31% speed-up for using LLaMA3.1-8B, Phi3.5-mini,
and Qwen2-1.5B prefill stages, respectively, in TTFT.
Weight Compression . Figure 8a illustrates the impact
Fig. 8: (a) Reduction in prefill and decode latency and SoC
energy due to weight quantization (LLaMA3-8B) and struc-
tured sparsity (LLaMA2-7B) (b) Comparison of LLaMA2-7B

GPU, and NPU inference.
of weight compression techniques. Specifically, per-channel
weight quantization from INT8 to INT4 in LLaMA3-8B
resulted in a 12% reduction in TTFT and a 33% reduction in
TPOT. This optimization led to a 14% decrease in SoC energy
consumption during the prefill stage and a 35% reduction
during the decode stage. The pronounced impact on TPOT
is attributed to the memory-bound nature of the decode phase,
where lower precision effectively reduces memory traffic.
Conversely, 2:4 structured sparsity applied to LLaMA2-
7B achieved a 48% reduction in prefill latency and a 49%
reduction in decode latency at the inference pipeline level.
These improvements translated to a 28% reduction in TTFT
and a 17% reduction in TPOT at the SoC level. Further-
more, we observed enhancements in effective TOPS per Watt
(eTOPS/W) at the NPU level, with improvements of 1.69×
and1.23×, respectively. These gains contributed to a 30%
reduction in SoC energy consumption during the prefill stage
and an 18% reduction during the decode stage.
KV Optimization . We present the performance results for
both lossy and lossless KV cache optimizations applied to
LLaMA3.1-8B, utilizing per-channel quantized INT4 weights
and FP16 activations/KV . Table II details the impact of KV
eviction (lossy). The baseline prefill KV size is 4096, with
normalized TPOT speed-up values provided relative to this
baseline. It is important to note that, due to the NPU’s support
for only static-shaped LLMs, the KV budget was constrained
to the maximum prompt length SLP, while the maximum
response length SLRwas fixed at 32. No additional optimiza-
tions were applied for this measurement. KV Zero-Copy Up-
date (lossless) delivers a 47% TPOT speed-up under the same
model configuration with fixed SLP/SL R= 1024 /32. This
performance gain stems from eliminating redundant SRAM-
to-DRAM traffic and avoiding intermediate copy operations
between CPU and NPU allocated memory spaces.
Performance of CPU, GPU, NPU . Figure 8b provides a
comparative analysis of CPU, GPU, and NPU performance
for the LLaMA2-7B model (INT4 weights, FP16 act/KV),
with SLP/SL R= 128 /128. Regarding TPOT, the GPU
demonstrates a 53% reduction compared to the CPU, while
the NPU achieves a 67% reduction. Although the GPU offers
higher raw performance due to its higher peak TOPS [57],
this comes at the expense of increased power consumption.
In contrast, the NPU achieves a Joules/token efficiency that is
1.58×better than the CPU and 1.2×better than the GPU.
VII. C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
This paper delineates a holistic blueprint for next-generation
NPUs that can natively support the evolving algorithmic

and optimization trends of large foundation models. Look-
ing ahead, several hardware opportunities remain ripe for
exploration. For example, native support for sparse atten-
tion kernels—especially those combining block-sparse and
unstructured patterns would unlock further compute savings
for long-sequence processing. Additionally, optimal hardware
and software support for emerging models, including linear
and hybrid attention mechanisms, alongside ultra-low preci-
sion tensor compute, would provide developers with greater
flexibility. Ternary datatypes, which restrict values to just three
discrete states, offer compelling opportunities for compression,
bandwidth reduction, and energy-efficient compute. Also, 3D
interconnects between compute and memory to reduce data
movement presents a promising future research.
